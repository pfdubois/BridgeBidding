Notes on how to build the book

~/.zprofile needs to reflect the current Python and pip versions.

make clean all

populates the directory docs with the html site, and the epub and pdf files, along with
zip files for the html and text outputs.

The Tex Live distribution for the Mac, MacTeX is installed, along with the latest Python and 
Sphinx packages.

To update Python: pip install --update Python
To update Sphinx: pip install --update Sphinx
To update MacTex see their site.

GitHub / Github pages used to do version control and publishing from the BridgeBidding 
repository, see github.com.

git push from the computer publishes to pfdubois.github.io/BridgeBidding.  
The file .docs/.nojekyll is needed to get the themes right.

The workflow is:
   Edit files (I use BBEdit)
   In a terminal navigate to BridgeBidding directory. Then:
      make html
      open build/html/index.html to check results.
      
   I do that first to be sure I see error messages in the html build. 
   Then:
      make all
      This cleans then populates the docs subdirectory. That directory becomes the
      website after you do the git push below.)
      
      Commit changes to the local git:
      git add .
      git commit -m'explanation' .
      Then publish to GitHub (changes visible to the public) with 
      git push
      
      (Assuming you have git properly connected and credentialed to pfdubois.github.com)
