<p>Methods of dealing with competition are woven throughout the other bidding topics.
This chapter contains some general principles to guide you.  The following two
chapters contain some particulars on competing in suits and in notrump.</p>
<p>In an established partnership, you can develop a style – be it aggressive,
conservative, insane cowboy, you name it. It is important to realize that
it isn’t so much that a given style is right or wrong, but that you bid
as a partnership knowing what that style is. If you overcall very lightly,
for example, your partner must be more conservative with replies to those
overcalls.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do not bid your same values twice.</p>
<p>For example, you open 1♥, LHO overcalls 1♠, your partner bids 2♥, and RHO
raises to 2♠. Do you now compete to 3♥?</p>
<p>Ask yourself, “Do I have something more to tell my partner?” If your hand was
an ordinary 13 point opening hand, you have shown those values already. Pass.
Only go on if you have something extra, such as more points or more trump.</p>
<p>If LHO now passes, your partner can use the same principal – he has promised
you six points and three hearts, but if he really has nine points or has four hearts,
then he hasn’t told you everything, so he can consider bidding 3♥ or doubling 2♠.</p>
<p>Another way to look at this is that thirteen plus nine should be about right
for the three level, all the more so with four trumps. Vulnerable, with only
three trumps, a double might get you to the dreaded -200.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Another guideline is the “Law of Total Tricks”, which says that with a fit,
the total number of tricks available in the hand is the sum of the lengths
of the trump holdings. For example, in a competitive auction where they have
shown an 8 card spade fit and we have a 9 card heart fit, there are 17 Tricks
available. So if they can make 8 tricks in spades, we will be able to make 9 Tricks
in hearts.</p>
<p>In particular just remember that with a nine-card fit you’re not going to get too
burned at the three level.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul id="index-0">
<li><p>Never preempt over a preempt. For example, they open 2♥ and you have six or seven
spades to the KJ and another King. Pass. You must not bid 2♠ or 3♠. Your partner will
consider those to be strong bids. This situation is also an exception to the saying
that jumps in competition are weak. You aren’t weak or you wouldn’t bid.  2♠ over 2♥
shows a good opening hand with spades, but 3♠ shows a stronger hand.</p></li>
<li><p>A passed hand is not always a poor hand. If your partner passed
after LHO opened, it may be that he did not have enough to overcall. It
may also be that he did have enough, but didn’t have a good enough suit, or his
suit is the one LHO bid. That’s completely different from your partner
passing in the first seat. It helps to say in your mind, “Partner has
a hand that could not bid over that opener.” That’s not the same at all
as “Partner has less than an opener.” We’ll see this at work in the section on
reopening with a double.</p></li>
<li><p>Realize when you are “off the hook”. Your partner makes a takeout double, but
your RHO bids over it.  Or, your partner makes an <a class="reference internal" href="CompetingSuit.html#unusual"><span class="std std-ref">Unusual 2N</span></a> bid but
RHO intervenes.  You’re off the hook!  You do not have to bid unless you have a
worthwhile thing to say. When you do make such a “free” bid, your partner will infer
that you have some reason to bid; when you bid because you have to, he cannot make
such an inference. To bid, you will be short in their suit and shapely.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t be cheap. If your partner makes a takeout double, and you bid the lowest
thing you can, you’re saying you don’t have 8 good points. Just because it is a
competitive auction doesn’t mean to always go low.</p></li>
<li><p>Competing with balanced hands (e.g. 5332) but no fit is never as good as it looks.
Lean toward defending.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have no defensive values, lean toward competing with something positive like
an extra trump.</p></li>
<li><p>Extreme shapes call for extreme measures.</p>
<p>Read Marty Bergen’s famous book, <cite>Points Schmoints</cite>. If you have a double fit,
or you have a 6 - 5 hand, get really aggressive.  “Six-Five, Come Alive” they say.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>To <a class="reference internal" href="Balancing.html#balancing"><span class="std std-ref">balance</span></a> is to bid in the <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-passout-seat"><span class="xref std std-term">passout seat</span></a>. As a simple
guideline, bid as though you had one more King in your hand, and your partner in
reply will bid as though he had one fewer. At matchpoints, if your opponents are
attempting to pass out two of a major, try very hard to balance.
Be sure to balance properly and you’ll be a valued partner.</p></li>
<li><p>If partner balances, but the opponents “take the push” by going one higher, we
don’t double and we don’t raise.  For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(1♥) P (2♥)  P
(P ) X (P)  2♠
(3♥)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The balancing double here borrowed a King in strength from partner. Neither of us
should now bid 3♠ or double for penalty. The balance did its job. They might go down
one now being a level too high. If they don’t, we weren’t likely to make 3♠.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do not “sacrifice” against a part-score. Very rarely sacrifice vulnerable. Be hesitant
about sacrificing at the five-level; if you are vulnerable you’d be better off if you
almost never did it.</p></li>
<li><p>When you and partner have bid and raised a major suit, bidding another suit is NEVER
done to try to find a better fit. I call this the Church of We Agreed – we agreed, so
I am not suggesting we look elsewhere. I’m saying something else – asking for help
in that suit, or showing a control, or asking for a control, for example.</p></li>
<li><p>When you and partner have agreed on a minor suit, bids below 3N <em>show</em> stoppers.
Bidding NT shows stoppers in all the unbid suits. If at some point there is only
one suit where you have not found stoppers, bidding that suit <em>asks</em> partner to bid
NT if he has a stopper in that suit.</p></li>
<li><p>It is usually the person who is short in their agreed suit that needs to do some
competing if appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p>If they agree a suit after your partner’s overcall, for you to proceed to the three
level in another suit is to agree with your partner’s suit. For example,
(1♥) 1♠ (2♥) 3♣ – you can’t be looking for a fit at the three level when your partner
might only have 8 points, so this bid shows spade support and a good club suit.
This extra information helps partner decide how high to go.</p></li>
<li><p>Look for a reason to bid, not a reason to pass, but don’t bid without a reason.
We are never “just competing”. This is admittedly tougher to judge in matchpoints.</p></li>
