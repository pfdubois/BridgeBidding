<span id="index-0"></span><h2>What Hands Do We Open Two Clubs?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-hands-do-we-open-two-clubs" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>An opening bid of two clubs is the strongest possible opening bid,
showing 22 or more points if the hand is balanced. If the hand is not balanced,
but rather has a long solid major suit, you can open it two clubs if it has at
least 8 ½ tricks in it and at least 16-18 HCP. It is too misleading to
partner to open a weaker hand with two clubs no matter how shapely.
For a minor you’d want to have more like 9 ½ - 10 tricks.</p>
<p>You also need at least 4 quick-tricks.  Here’s how you count quick-tricks, up to 2 per
suit:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>AK = 2 quick tricks</p></li>
<li><p>A = 1 quick trick</p></li>
<li><p>KQ = 1 quick trick</p></li>
<li><p>AQ = 1 1/2 quick tricks</p></li>
<li><p>Kx = 1/2 quick trick</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A typical opening bid has two quick-tricks.</p>
<p>There are many two-suited hands which you should not open 2♣.
2♣ uses up a lot of bidding room and makes it hard to show both suits.  However,
if your strength is above 22 HCP, you pretty much have no choice.</p>
<p>The responses are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>2♦ is purely artificial, indicating that none of the other following bids apply.
Responder really tells you nothing about his hand when he bids 2♦, except
that he probably does not have 8 HCP and a good five-card major.
People call this 2♦ “waiting”.</p>
<p>If you have a very bad hand you bid 2♦ first and on your second bid bid 3♣, called
the “second negative” or “double negative”.  If opener has rebid 3♦ so that you cannot
bid 3♣, bid 3♥ as “artificial, double negative”.  Be sure partner knows this.
(I am obliged to explain double negative; it is standard. I hate this method. Some feel
it is better not to have a second negative at all.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>2♥, 2♠ show at least 8 HCP and a <em>good</em> five card suit. Game forcing.</p></li>
<li><p>3♣, 3♦ show at least 8 HCP and a <em>good</em> six card suit. Game forcing.</p>
<p>Be very reluctant to bid 3♦; sometimes you need to show your
club suit immediately with 3♣ because to do so on your second bid would show a weak
hand. Knowing that your second bid may have to be 3♦ is a reason to resist bidding
2♣. Gavin Wolpert calls 2♣ - 2♦ - 3♦ “the worst auction in bridge”.</p>
</li>
<li><p>2N should not be bid.  Traditional teaching is that 2N shows 8 HCP and a balanced
hand, but it is not a good idea. Just bid 2♦.  After that make sure you get to game.
I’d write it on your convention card: Never 2N.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Opener rebids 2N with a balanced 22-24, 3N with 25-27, and so on.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>When opener rebids 2N after opening 2♣ the auction proceeds exactly as if he had
opened 2N, except that his hand is stronger.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>A 2♦ reply is not alerted or announced any more, no matter what it means.
Do not assume you know.  If you’re not going to bid, ask after the auction is over.</p>
</div>
<p>It should be noted that while responder may pass a 2N rebid with a bad hand,
all the suit bids by opener are unlimited and completely forcing. Holding:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>♠234 ♥234 ♦2345 ♣234
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and hearing partner rebid 2♠, you must bid. Bid 4♠ and pray. Unfortunately 3♠ is
setting trump and suggesting slam.</p>
<p>Alternate schemes for responding to 2♣ are described in
<a class="reference internal" href="Advanced2Clubs.html#two-club-stuff"><span class="std std-ref">Advanced Responses To Two Club Openers</span></a>.</p>
<p class="rubric">Interference</p>
<p>If your 2♣ opener is interfered with by the opener’s LHO, responder’s actions are quite
unintuitive:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Pass is forcing and shows values (no alert is required);</p></li>
<li><p>Double shows a weak hand.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To interfere with your opponent’s 2♣ opener, the simplest idea is <a class="reference internal" href="InterestingGadgets.html#mathe"><span class="std std-ref">Mathe</span></a>:
double shows both majors and 2N is <a class="reference internal" href="CompetingSuit.html#unusual"><span class="std std-ref">Unusual 2N</span></a>.</p>
<p class="rubric">No Need For Opening 3N</p>
<p>The standard SAYC meaning of a 3N opener is a 25-27 point hand, but this bid
is redundant. You can open 2♣ first and then bid 3N to show that. Therefore you might
agree to use a 3N opening for something else, such as
<a class="reference internal" href="Preempts.html#gambling3n"><span class="std std-ref">Gambling 3N Opening</span></a>.</p>
<p>It doesn’t happen a lot, but the 4N rebid means 28-30, etc. If you open 2♣ and the
auction goes 2♣ - 2♦ - 4N, your partner will stare at you like a deer caught in the
headlights. You aren’t asking for keycards in diamonds, of course; that was an
artificial suit.</p>
<p>Stayman and transfers would be on if 3N is the strong, balanced opener.</p>
