<p>If using this chapter as a reference, be sure you’ve read
<a class="reference internal" href="Nomenclature.html#notation"><span class="std std-ref">Notation and Nomenclature</span></a> and review
<a class="reference internal" href="Planning.html#classification"><span class="std std-ref">Classifying Your Hand</span></a> to classify your hand as weak, competitive,
invitational, opening-strength, or strong.</p>
<p>When a hand is eligible to open in notrump, we are anxious to do so. As we will see,
we will have an entire system devoted to bidding such hands that almost always gets us,
if we are not disturbed, to a good contract.  The “system” is very extensive, which is
why this chapter is so long.</p>
<p>If you are not very experienced, a good target is to get through the section
<a class="reference internal" href="#transfers"><span class="std std-ref">Major Transfers</span></a> and make sure you and your partner are solid on
that much.</p>
<section id="when-do-you-open-notrump">
<h2>When Do You Open Notrump?<a class="headerlink" href="#when-do-you-open-notrump" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>With many bids it matters what your strength and shape are and these might vary with
which <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-seat"><span class="xref std std-term">seat</span></a> you’re in.  With notrump, there is no variation with seat.
The hand must have:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A shape that is <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-balanced"><span class="xref std std-term">balanced</span></a>, 4-3-3-3, 4-4-3-2, or 5-3-3-2.
No voids, no singletons, and at most one doubleton.</p></li>
<li><p>A HCP strength in a specific range:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>15-17 open 1N</p></li>
<li><p>20-21 open 2N</p></li>
<li><p>22-24 open 2♣ and rebid 2N</p></li>
<li><p>25-27 open 2♣ and rebid 3N, and so on.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What about hands with the right shape but wrong strength?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>12-14 points with no five-card major: open a minor and bid notrump on
the second round. If you do have a five-card major, open it.</p></li>
<li><p>18-19 points open a suit, and bid 2N on the second round.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>You’ll encounter people playing “weak notrumps”, where the range does not include 16,
such as (most popularly) 12-14.  They open 1N in that range. They open a suit then
rebid 1N when their hand is a traditional 1N opener, alerting that 1N bid.</p>
</div>
<p class="rubric">Hands You Sometimes Open 1N</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>As you get more experience, you may want to open 1N with some <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-semi-balanced"><span class="xref std std-term">semi-balanced</span></a>
hands in the 15-17 HCP range. You can consider this with these shapes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A 5-4-2-2 hand, as long as one of the doubletons is Kx or better, and
the long suit is a minor or you are specifically 4=5=2=2. With
5=4=2=2 you always open 1♠ and rebid 2♥.</p></li>
<li><p>A 6-3-2-2 hand if the long suit is a good minor and both doubletons
are Kx or better, and the long suit is a minor.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Should you open 1N with a five-card major? Almost always. There are a few
hands, where the major contains say 9 or 10 of the points, that you might open
1M, but you’ll always struggle to get partner to believe your strength.</p>
<p>When you are more experienced you’ll likely find yourself wanting to upgrade some
14 point hands that contain a good five-card suit and open them 1N.</p>
<p>When overcalling the opponents, be careful about doing it with 15 HCP hands – you’ll
need a five-card or longer suit anyway, and bidding that suit may be preferable.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Never downgrade a hand with 18 HCP to open 1N. Do upgrade 17 HCP hands with five-card
suits, especially if that suit is a good minor, rebidding 2N next.</p>

<span id="index-1"></span><h2>How To Choose A Response To 1N<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-choose-a-response-to-1n" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The responder is going to reply using an extremely well-defined structure, the “system”,
which has a high probability of getting you to a good contract. This “system” is so useful
that we try to use it whenever we can:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>After we open or overcall 1N;</p></li>
<li><p>When we open 2N;</p></li>
<li><p>When we open 2♣ and rebid notrump.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Important:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The system is not on when opener bids a suit and rebids notrump.</p></li>
<li><p>When the 1N opener’s LHO bids or doubles, it varies.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of this chapter is devoted to explaining the “system” over 1N.  You’ll
notice it is a very long chapter, because there are a lot of subtleties.
The ideas mostly carry over to the higher-level notrump bids as detailed in
<a class="reference internal" href="TwoNT.html#open2n"><span class="std std-ref">The 2N Opening Family</span></a>.</p>
<p>When you open in notrump, you have told your partner your strength within 3 points,
and that you have a balanced shape. This means your partner is actually best placed
to decide where you are going, because he knows his own hand and a lot about yours,
while you know nothing of his yet.  For now at least, he’s the <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-Captain"><span class="xref std std-term">Captain</span></a>.</p>
<p>Assume your partner has opened 1N. You, as responder, should:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Classify the strength of your hand (weak, competitive, invitational,
game forcing, or slam interest).  Opposite a 15-17 1N bid, 8 or 9 HCP is
invitational, while with 10 HCP you must force to game – you can’t make a
bid that opener can pass short of game.</p></li>
<li><p>See if you have a four-card, five-card, or longer major(s), or not.
These cases are each treated differently. We have special rules when 5-4 in
the majors.</p></li>
<li><p>In hands with no majors, note if the hand has a 6(or more)-card minor. Do not
do anything special on your first response with a five-card minor.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, a hand whose principal feature is a long minor wants to be in
3N if it is strong enough, unless it is a strong hand that might want to be in a
minor slam. This is especially true playing matchpoints.</p>
<section id="responding-with-no-major-suit-or-long-minor">
<span id="index-2"></span><span id="quantitative-raises"></span><h3>Responding With No Major Suit Or Long Minor<a class="headerlink" href="#responding-with-no-major-suit-or-long-minor" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>In responding to your partner’s 1N opener, if you determine that
there is no 4(or more) card major suit or 6(or more) card minor, your actions are determined
by your point count alone:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>With fewer than 8 HCP, pass.</p></li>
<li><p>With an invitational hand (8-9 HCP) bid 2N.</p></li>
<li><p>With a game-going hand (10-15 HCP), bid 3N.</p></li>
<li><p>With a slam invitational hand (16+-17 HCP) bid 4N.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>4N is a <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-quantitative"><span class="xref std std-term">quantitative</span></a> raise. Responder has enough for 6N if
the opener is on the top of his bid, a good 16 or 17. If responder is SURE
that the partnership has 33 points, this bid is not appropriate.</p>
<p>There are times a bid of 4N is asking your partner about Aces, but not
here. A bid of 4N is also <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-quantitative"><span class="xref std std-term">quantitative</span></a> after 2N or 3N openers, or after the
opener rebids 1N after a suit opening, or bids 2N after a strong 2♣ opening.</p>
<p>Classically:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>With 18-19 HCP, bid 6N.  We’re sure we have 33 HCP, so we can’t be off two Aces.</p></li>
<li><p>With 20-21 HCP, Grand Slam Force with 5N. The opener should reply 6N or 7N.</p></li>
<li><p>With 22 or more HCP, give your partner a thrill with a bid of 7N.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can ask for Aces with 4♣ (<a class="reference internal" href="Slam.html#id3"><span class="std std-ref">Gerber</span></a>) in lieu of the direct slam bids,
if you are worried about having fast losers in a suit or an opener that upgraded a
14 HCP hand. It doesn’t hurt to be careful.</p>
<p id="index-3">The 5N bid as Grand Slam Force is the standard but it has been all but replaced by
<a class="reference internal" href="AdvancedSlam.html#pick-a-slam"><span class="std std-ref">5N Pick-A-Slam</span></a>. Whichever you play it applies to a 5N bid
over a quantitative 4N bid or below.</p>

<h3>Responding With A Major Suit Or Long Minor<a class="headerlink" href="#responding-with-a-major-suit-or-long-minor" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>When your hand does have a 4(or more) card major suit or a 6(or more)-card minor suit,
you’ll begin with one of the techniques discussed later in this chapter
(<a class="reference internal" href="#stayman"><span class="std std-ref">Stayman</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#transfers"><span class="std std-ref">transfers to majors</span></a>, or
<a class="reference internal" href="#minor-relay"><span class="std std-ref">Minor Relay</span></a>). These all force your partner to reply in a
certain way.</p>
<p>After he replies, if you bid 4N when it is your next turn, that’s <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-quantitative"><span class="xref std std-term">quantitative</span></a>,
not Ace-asking. If he bid a suit because you made him do it, it doesn’t mean you have
agreed on a suit.  You may have found a fit but he doesn’t know about it yet.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>Whenever 4N is <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-quantitative"><span class="xref std std-term">quantitative</span></a>, 4♣ (<a class="reference internal" href="Slam.html#id3"><span class="std std-ref">Gerber</span></a>) is
Ace-asking.</p>
</div>
<p>With no other agreement, responses of 4♦, 4♥, 4♠, 5♣, 5♦ are natural, to play,
with at least a six-card suit; but see <a class="reference internal" href="#texas"><span class="std std-ref">Texas Transfers</span></a> as an option for
getting to 4♥ or 4♠.</p>
<p>We’ll now start digging into those special cases where responder has a four-card or
longer major, or a six-card or longer minor.</p>

<section id="stayman-convention">
<span id="index-4"></span><span id="stayman"></span><h2>Stayman Convention<a class="headerlink" href="#stayman-convention" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>After a 1N opener, 2♣ is an artificial bid called <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-Stayman"><span class="xref std std-term">Stayman</span></a>, promising a
four-card major and asking the opener to say if he does or does not have a four
(or five) card major.  There are three circumstances in which responder bids 2♣
Stayman:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Responder has an exactly four-card major, the hand is not <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-flat"><span class="xref std std-term">flat</span></a>, and it has at
least invitational values.</p></li>
<li><p>Responder has a less than invitational hand with a stiff or void in clubs, and
intends to pass whatever response he gets. Ideally responder has a shape like 4=4=5=0
or 4=4=4=1.</p></li>
<li><p>Responder’s hand is 5-4 in the majors, any strength.
See <a class="reference internal" href="#fivefour"><span class="std std-ref">When Responder Is 5-4 In The Majors</span></a>.
See <a class="reference internal" href="#garbagestayman"><span class="std std-ref">Garbage Stayman</span></a> for when it is weak.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The goal of Stayman is to discover if we have a major fit, and at the same
time to decide if we have a game or not.  We first answer the question about
the fit, and then the question about the game.</p>
<p>If you have a five-card major and fewer than four in the other major, we use
<a class="reference internal" href="#transfers"><span class="std std-ref">Major Transfers</span></a>, regardless of strength, not Stayman.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Stayman 2♣ is artificial but not alerted, because it has become common practice.
Responder might have no clubs.</p>
</div>
<p class="rubric">Opener Reveals His Major Holdings</p>
<p id="index-5">After 1N - 2♣, opener <em>must</em> choose one of three replies: 2♦, 2♥, or 2♠.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>2♦ no four-card major.</p></li>
<li><p>2♥ 4+ hearts, and maybe 4 spades.</p></li>
<li><p>2♠ 4+ spades, but denies 4 hearts, or the spades are longer than your hearts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If opener has four hearts and four spades, he bids 2♥.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Opener must bid 2♦, 2♥, or 2♠, never anything else. Never 2N.</p>
</div>
<p class="rubric">Responder Indicates Strength and Fit</p>
<p>After the reply to Stayman, responder continues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>With a weak hand short in clubs, he passes.</p></li>
<li><p>With a less than invitational hand that is 5-4 in the majors he bids
the five-card suit, <a class="reference internal" href="#garbagestayman"><span class="std std-ref">Garbage Stayman</span></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise he indicates whether a fit has been
found, and whether his hand is invitational, game forcing, or has slam
interest:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If a fit has been found, responder tells opener the good news: he raises the
major suit to the 3-level to invite game, or to the four level to play.</p></li>
<li><p>If a fit has been found but responder has too good a hand to bid game,  bidding
three of the other major (3W) shows a power raise (18+ HCP).  It is a game force,
of course.</p>
<p>For example: 1N - 2♣ - 2♠ - 3♥!(power raise). Now opener should start
<a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-control-bidding"><span class="xref std std-term">control bidding</span></a>. (Control bidding will be discussed later).</p>
</li>
<li><p>With no fit, Responder bids notrump; how many notrump shows responder’s strength:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>2N no fit, with an invitational hand.</p></li>
<li><p>3N no fit, but enough points for game.</p></li>
<li><p>Three level bids in a new suit are game forcing and may show interest in a
slam.</p></li>
<li><p>4N is a <a class="reference internal" href="#quantitative-raises"><span class="std std-ref">quantitative raise</span></a> denying a fit.</p></li>
<li><p>4♣ is plain <a class="reference internal" href="Slam.html#id3"><span class="std std-ref">Gerber</span></a>, asking opener how many Aces they have.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that having checked for a fit, the responder may know whether there is a
fit or not but the opener does not know it yet. So, a sequence like 1N - 2♣ -
2♠ - 4N is a <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-quantitative"><span class="xref std std-term">quantitative</span></a> raise, not Ace-asking; and 4♣! is asking for
Aces with <a class="reference internal" href="Slam.html#id3"><span class="std std-ref">Gerber</span></a> and agreeing to the suit.</p>
<p class="rubric">Opener’s Third Bid</p>
<p>If opener has both majors he first bids 2♥.  If responder bids 2N in reply, then
there is no heart fit, but opener knows there is a spade fit. Opener should bid spades
at the three-level to decline the invitation, and at the four-level to accept it. If
responder has bid 3N, opener can switch to 4♠.</p>
</section>
<section id="major-transfers">
<h2>Major Transfers<a class="headerlink" href="#major-transfers" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-6"><span id="transfers"></span>So much for hands with four card majors – but what if you have a five-card
major? You may have a fit if opener has three cards in your suit.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If you have 5-4 in the majors, you use Stayman.  This section applies when
you have fewer than four cards in the other major.</p>
</div>
<p>Rather than bid our major suit in response to 1N, we bid the suit below
it. This is called a <em class="dfn">transfer</em>, also known as
a Jacoby Transfer. Opener announces “transfer”. The opener will accept the transfer
by bidding the next suit up.</p>
<p>See <a class="reference internal" href="AdvancedTransfers.html#transferlanguage"><span class="std std-ref">Transfers and Relays Expand Our Language</span></a> for more
explanation of the benefits of transfers and relays. Jacoby Transfers and
Stayman are the first two conventional bids that you learn.  They are not some
esoteric thing you can skip – any partner will assume you know them. But for now,
you don’t have to reason why, yours is to but do or die.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1N – 2♦ is a transfer to hearts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>2♥ Opener completes (“accepts”) the transfer. Opener might have two cards in the
suit, so no fit has been found yet.</p></li>
<li><p>3♥ Opener has 4+ hearts and a maximum 1N bid (<a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-super-accept"><span class="xref std std-term">super-accept</span></a>)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>1N – 2♥ is a transfer to spades.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>2♠ completes the transfer.</p></li>
<li><p>3♠ Opener has 4+ spades and a maximum 1N bid (<a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-super-accept"><span class="xref std std-term">super-accept</span></a>).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike Stayman, responder’s strength is not an issue. A poor hand containing one
five-card or longer major, even if it has zero points, must transfer to that suit,
since responder’s hand will be worth something with that suit as trumps and little or
nothing otherwise.</p>
<p>Note that the weaker your hand is, the more important it is to transfer – to make
something out of nothing. Transfer to spades even if your spade holding is ♠65432.
Or, not to put too fine a point on it, as Charles Dickens would say,
<em>especially</em> if your spade holding is ♠65432.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Opener must remember that responder has not promised anything yet except
five cards in the target suit – not even ONE high-card point.</p>
</div>
<p>If you ever find yourself arguing to yourself that your partner <em>probably</em> has
some points because he transferred, you’ve fallen in love with your hand again,
and you know these affairs end badly.</p>
<p>The opener has to accept the transfer precisely because his partner may have
absolutely nothing else.</p>
<p>For an advanced choice for a “superaccept”, see
<a class="reference internal" href="AdvancedTransfers.html#advancedsuperaccepts"><span class="std std-ref">Advanced Superaccepts</span></a>.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-7">After The Major Transfer</p>
<p>After a transfer to 2M is accepted, responder bids:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Pass with less than invitational values.</p></li>
<li><p>2N invitational. Opener can pass, bid 3N, or bid 3M or 4M with 3-card support.</p></li>
<li><p>3m a second suit, absolutely game forcing, usually with at least mild slam interest.</p></li>
<li><p>3M invitational, 6+ cards in the major. Now we have an 8-card fit for sure. Opener
must revalue his hand, but he may then choose to pass.</p></li>
<li><p>3N to play, opener can correct to 4M with 3 trumps.</p></li>
<li><p>4M to play, 6+ cards in the major.</p></li>
<li><p>4♣ Gerber</p></li>
<li><p>4N <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-quantitative"><span class="xref std std-term">quantitative</span></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, avoid confusion by remembering that after a transfer, any bid at the
three-level or higher except for the raise to 3M establishes a game force.
If your partner transfers you to hearts and then bids 3♣, you can’t pass just
because you have two hearts and five clubs.  Partner may be interested in 3N or
maybe even 6♣. If the latter does not look likely, you’ll probably just bid 3N.</p>
<p>After a super-accept, the responder decides on whether to pass or bid game
or try for slam. He knows a great deal about opener’s hand. Bidding another suit should
be a control, looking for slam.</p>

<p>When opener’s LHO interferes, such as 1N (2♠), see
<a class="reference internal" href="#ninterference"><span class="std std-ref">Dealing With Interference Over 1N</span></a>. Short answer: the standard
is that bids are natural, and a redouble is Stayman. Double is by agreement but most
usefully takeout at the two-level.</p>
<p>One thing to know right now is that you cannot transfer on the three-level, as in
1N (2♠) 3♦ – not a transfer to hearts.  This is a common beginner error.</p>
<p>Doubles of artificial bids such as Stayman and transfer bids are almost always
asking for that suit to be led. This is called a <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-lead-directing"><span class="xref std std-term">lead-directing</span></a> bid.</p>
<p>If opener’s RHO doubles or overcalls Stayman or a transfer bid,
responder will take the lead in punishing them since only responder knows how many
points he has. Neither Stayman nor a transfer promised any points. See:</p>

<p>You should learn these defenses as part of learning Stayman and transfers.</p>

<span id="index-9"></span><h3>Garbage Stayman<a class="headerlink" href="#garbage-stayman" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p id="garbagestayman">The term <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-Garbage-Stayman"><span class="xref std std-term">Garbage Stayman</span></a> is often mistakenly used. A standard part of
Stayman is that you can bid 2♣ with a weak hand having a club shortage and
three-card or better support in the other suits. You’re willing to pass any
reply, including 2♦. Your hand may be garbage, but you’re not bidding Garbage
Stayman.</p>
<p>Garbage Stayman refers to bidding weak hands that are 4-4 or better
in the majors. The idea is that you can bid Stayman even if you are not willing to pass
a 2♦ reply. Playing Garbage Stayman, you now rebid 2♥!(weak, 4-4 in majors) and opener
passes or corrects to 2♠.</p>
<p>There is a more complicated version I am not mentioning, so check with partner.</p>

<section id="when-responder-is-5-4-in-the-majors">
<span id="fivefour"></span><span id="index-10"></span><h2>When Responder Is 5-4 In The Majors<a class="headerlink" href="#when-responder-is-5-4-in-the-majors" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you have five in one major and exactly four in the other, some special bids are
available. Here is our scheme to try to find either a 4-4 or 5-3 fit:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If your hand is weak, transfer to the five-card suit
and pass. This gives your partner no chance to go wrong.  But use judgement: with
a terrible five-card suit, you might try Garbage Stayman.</p></li>
<li><p>If your hand has five spades and four hearts, invitational or better, bid 2♣ Stayman,
and then:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If opener shows a major, just raise it. Example: 1N - 2♣ - 2♥ - 3♥ invitational;
1N - 2♣ - 2♥ - 4♥ with a game-forcing hand.</p></li>
<li><p>If opener answered 2♦, you may still have a 5-3 fit. Bid 2♠ to invite; 3♠ to force
to game.  See note below.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If your hand has four spades and five hearts, invitational or better, a similar scheme
does not work. The problem arises after 1N - 2♣ - 2♦, because to bid 2♥ is
<a class="reference internal" href="#garbagestayman"><span class="std std-ref">Garbage Stayman</span></a>; opener might pass. And you can’t bid 3♥ if
you do not have a game-forcing hand; you’re already too high for an invitational hand
if partner doesn’t have hearts. So:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>With an invitational hand 4=5 in the majors, you have to transfer to hearts and
then bid 2♠.</p></li>
<li><p>With a game-forcing hand, use Stayman and if opener bids 2♦, bid 3♥. See note below.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Partners must be on their toes not to pass the game-forcing bids.</p>
<p class="rubric">The Hand And Stayman</p>
<p id="index-11">In <a class="reference internal" href="HandEvaluation.html#thehand"><span class="std std-ref">The Hand</span></a> we met these two hands and evaluated them to around
16 and 15 points each:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>West           East
♠K862          ♠AQ
♥AKJ95         ♥T632
♦T5            ♦AKQ6
♣KJ            ♣964
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>East was the dealer, and with 15 HCP and a balanced hand opens 1N. West is 5-4 in the
majors so replies 2♣, Stayman. East bids 2♥, her lowest four-card major.</p>
<p>Extra points if you know what West does next: 3♠! which is the power raise for hearts.
It agrees that hearts are trump and asks partner to start showing controls. East
would then bid 4♦ to show the A♦ but deny the A♣.</p>
<p>With a minimal opening hand West would just have bid 4♥ over 2♥. Note that
1N - 2♣ - 2♥ - 3♥ would agree that hearts are trump but would be just invitational,
8-9 points.  That’s why we need the 3♠ bid, agreeing hearts but game forcing at
least.</p>
</section>
<section id="texas-transfers">
<h2>Texas Transfers<a class="headerlink" href="#texas-transfers" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-12"><span id="texas"></span>Texas Transfers are not standard, but are so common you must be sure you agree on this
with your partner. Check the boxes on your convention cards.</p>
<p>If you have a six-card major and a minimum game forcing hand, you can use a
Texas Transfer:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1N - 4♦ transfer to hearts (6+, GF)</p></li>
<li><p>1N - 4♥ transfer to spades (6+, GF)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Texas Transfers are on over interference. The name Texas for Americans implies “big”:
big hats, big toast, big meat, big suit.</p>
<p>You don’t use Texas if:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>you have an invitational hand; instead you would transfer and then raise to 3M.</p></li>
<li><p>with mild slam interest; instead transfer and then bid 4M. This sequence shows you must
have a six-card suit because you are willing to play 4M even if opener has only two
trump.  But, you didn’t get to 4M fast with Texas – so the motto, “slow shows” applies;
you must have extras.  But it is only mild extras; if you have strong slam interest,
make a forcing bid such as a 3-level bid of a new suit. That is game forcing, so
you’ll get another bid.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="index-13">
<span id="minor-relay"></span><span id="id1"></span><h2>Minor Relay<a class="headerlink" href="#index-13" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The 2♠!(long minor) response to 1N forces opener to bid 3♣!(forced),
which responder can pass or correct to 3♦, to play. This is called a <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-relay"><span class="xref std std-term">relay</span></a>.</p>
<p>Opener alerts 2♠, and partner should alert the 3♣ reply because the opener
doesn’t necessarily have clubs.  Since it is an alert, not an announcement,
you do not say “relay to clubs” unless asked.</p>
<p>The Minor Relay is not for five-card minors, and not for
invitational or better hands or hands that have a four-card major. Minor relays are to be
used only in the case of 6 card suits, and usually only with weak hands.  A six-card
suit is very powerful opposite a 1N opener, so weak means not close to invitational.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>It is incorrect to call 2♠ a “minor suit transfer”.
Technically, a transfer is a bid asking partner to bid a suit that
you hold for certain; a <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-relay"><span class="xref std std-term">relay</span></a> is asking partner to bid a certain suit
(usually but not always the next <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-strain"><span class="xref std std-term">strain</span></a> up) but that suit isn’t necessarily the
suit you have; you are going to reveal that later.</p>
</div>
<section id="minor-slam-tries">
<span id="index-14"></span><h3>Minor Slam Tries<a class="headerlink" href="#minor-slam-tries" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>A Minor Relay can be used as the start of a slam try in a minor. You must have a belief
that a minor slam is likely, because otherwise 3N is your goal.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1N - 2♠! - 3♣! – 3♥! slam try in clubs.</p></li>
<li><p>1N - 2♠! - 3♣! – 3♠! slam try in diamonds.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You would never be bidding a major after a Minor Relay, because you would have
used Stayman or a transfer to that major in the first place. These bids are
clearly artificial. The lower bid (hearts) corresponds to a slam try in the
lower minor (clubs), and the higher bid (spades) to the higher minor
(diamonds).</p>

<span id="three-level-suit-responses"></span><span id="id2"></span><h2>Three-Level Suit Responses<a class="headerlink" href="#index-15" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The standard is that 3-level bids over 1N are natural, showing 6+ cards in the
suit, with invitational values.  However, there are about as many schemes for
the bids from 3♣ to 3♠ as there are bridge players.  In <a class="reference internal" href="AdvancedNotrump.html#advancednt"><span class="std std-ref">Advanced One

from 2♠ to 3♠ that replaces the Minor Relay and these three-level natural bids

<section id="recommended-1n-structure-for-intermediates">
<h2>Recommended 1N Structure for Intermediates<a class="headerlink" href="#recommended-1n-structure-for-intermediates" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Here is what I recommend for intermediates.  You’ll need partnership agreement.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Play the major transfers and Texas transfers, and
<a class="reference internal" href="#minor-relay"><span class="std std-ref">Minor Relay</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Play the natural 1N - 3x bids as invitational.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Do not try to get to five of a minor; the basic decision is whether to go past
3N or not.  Once you go past 3N, you’re going to really hope you can bid the
slam because 5m is usually a bad outcome (especially in matchpoints) if 3N is
making. The minor relay slam try has the virtue of letting opener call it off
with 3N or 5m depending on his hand; or he can control-bid or ask for Aces.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>A great many players, some with considerable experience, are misinformed about
sequences like 1N - 2♣ - 2M - 4N and 1N - 2T(transfer) - 2M - 4N. These are
all quantitative. Direct skeptics to any good book or professional web page on 2/1.
Do not let an allegedly more experienced partner bully you on this.</p>

<span id="index-16"></span><h2>Between 1N and 2N<a class="headerlink" href="#between-1n-and-2n" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you have 18-19 or more points, do not open 1N, even if your partner is a passed
hand. It isn’t going to take much to get you to game, so you don’t want to lie
about your strength by limiting it to 17 HCP. A seventeen with a great five card
suit should also be treated this way.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>With a balanced 18-19 points, open a suit and then rebid
2N. This does not deny any major that has been skipped over. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1♦ – 1♥ – 2N shows 18-19 balanced but does not deny holding four spades.
The convention <a class="reference internal" href="Checkback.html#nmf"><span class="std std-ref">New Minor Forcing</span></a> helps sort out whether the
1♥ bidder here has four or five hearts. It is worth learning.</p></li>
<li><p>Opening one of a suit and then overcalling 1N when partner passes shows 18-19
points and a stopper. (Double shows the same strength without a stopper.)
After the 1N bid, the bids that follow are natural, not the “systems on” bids.
In effect, the 1N rebid shows that you didn’t open 1N because your hand is too
good.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, suppose opener has an 18 point balanced hand with the Ace
of Spades, and responder has a 5 point hand with diamonds such as ♠98 ♥J42 ♦KJT93 ♣974</p>
<p>The bidding begins:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>1♣ (1♠) P  (P)

<p>Systems are off. The bid of 2♦ would be to play, not a transfer to hearts.</p>

<span id="ninterference"></span><h2>Dealing With Interference Over 1N<a class="headerlink" href="#dealing-with-interference-over-1n" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The no-trump structure is highly evolved and generally gets you to the right
place – so much so, that your opponents will be anxious to get in your way so
that you can’t use it. Ron Klinger lamented, “Nobody leaves anyone alone
any more.”  In a later <a class="reference internal" href="CompetingNT.html#n-defenses"><span class="std std-ref">section</span></a> we’ll learn some of
these evil schemes; meantime, here are the basics of how to deal with interference
after you’ve opened 1N.</p>
<p>The treatments for interference with major transfers and Stayman are a standard
part of those conventions.  Note that in either case responder has promised
absolutely no points, so generally responder controls the action.</p>
<p>When 1N is doubled:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Doubling a 2♣ overcall is Stayman.</p></li>
<li><p>If they make a penalty double, whatever agreements are in place for a
<a class="reference internal" href="#runout"><span class="std std-ref">Runout</span></a> apply.</p></li>
<li><p>If they make an artificial double, systems are on.</p></li>
<li><p>A cue-bid of diamonds, hearts, or spades is Stayman.</p></li>
<li><p>A double of diamonds, hearts, or spades is penalty – but this is one of those areas
where many players treat it as takeout at the two-level.</p></li>
<li><p>Bids at the 2-level are less than invitational, natural, to play.</p></li>
<li><p>Bids at the 3-level are game-forcing, natural.</p></li>
<li><p>Bidding 2NT is natural, invitational and promises a stopper in their suit.</p></li>
<li><p>Bidding 3NT is natural, and promises a stopper in their suit.</p></li>

<p>A double of an artificial bid is lead-directing. So, opener’s RHO may double
to show that he wants a lead of the (artificial) suit that responder just bid.
Opener can take advantage to tell responder if he has three or more of
responder’s suit. A decided minority of intermediates know the correct bids here.</p>
<p>Let T be the suit of the transfer bid, and let M be the target suit of the transfer.
For example, in 1N - 2♦(transfer), T is diamonds, M is hearts.</p>
<p>After 1N (P) 2T (X), the opponents are presumably bidding T:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Pass: Opener has 2 cards in M. M is not agreed trump.
Subsequently, if the next player passes, a XX by responder transfers again to M.
A bid of the transfer suit, such as 1N (P) 2♥ (X); P (P) 3♥ is
<a class="reference internal" href="CompetingSuit.html#id1"><span class="std std-ref">Western Cue</span></a> asking opener to bid 3N with a stopper.</p></li>
<li><p>2M: Agrees M as trump, shows 3+ cards in M.</p></li>
<li><p>3M: Agrees M as trump, shows 4+ cards in M, and a maximum opener.</p></li>
<li><p>XX: Opener has the transfer suit, willing to play in 2T redoubled. Opener
should have a positively scary holding in T.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An overcall of a transfer leaves the opener in a bit of a bind because
the act of transferring in itself only shows a five card suit; responder
could have zero points. So, opener only bids with a great holding in the
overcalled suit, or holding a maximum.</p>
<p>Thus after 1N - 2T (2Z):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Pass: waiting to hear from partner. Responder can double to show points.</p></li>
<li><p>X: penalty oriented, a great Z suit.</p></li>
<li><p>Completing the transfer shows a maximum with four-card support.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note the theme again: 4N is quantitative any time we have not affirmatively agreed
on a suit.</p>
<p>The responder is still <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-Captain"><span class="xref std std-term">Captain</span></a>, and we’re waiting to hear his opinion.</p>

<span id="staymandoubled"></span><h3>When Stayman is doubled or overcalled<a class="headerlink" href="#when-stayman-is-doubled-or-overcalled" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>When Stayman is doubled, opener will answer only if he has a club stopper. Otherwise
he passes it around to the responder, who can redouble to ask for Stayman again,
or pass for penalty.</p>
<p>When Stayman is overcalled, opener should usually pass and let responder decide
to double for penalty or not. I say this on general principles, I’ve never seen it
discussed.</p>

<section id="stolen-bids">
<span id="index-22"></span><span id="stolenbids"></span><h3>Stolen Bids<a class="headerlink" href="#stolen-bids" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>A system popular with intermediates for dealing with overcalls of our 1N opener is
called “stolen bids”. I think it is
correct to mention it here because so many of your
intermediate partners will think it is standard. More advanced players will know how
to play it but will be complaining that you should learn <a class="reference internal" href="Lebensohl.html#lebensohl"><span class="std std-ref">Lebensohl</span></a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1N (2a) X! means the same as if responder had bid the overcalled suit,
up to 2♠. In other words, a double means, “He stole my bid!”. In particular
a double of (2♣) is Stayman.</p></li>
<li><p>Any bid above the overcall has an unchanged meaning. However, bidding NT promises
a stopper in the overcalled suit. Example: 1N (2♦) 2♥!(transfer to spades).</p></li>
<li><p>The three level bids don’t have their special meanings; if a jump, it is a weak bid
in the suit, such as 1N - (2♦) - 3♥(preemptive, hearts).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You’re giving up the chance of a penalty double.  Also, when the opponents know this
is what you play, as they will at your club, or if they look at your card, they
can get away with murder interfering with you, knowing you can’t double them.</p>
<p>The right answer is some form of the Lebensohl convention, which is quite advanced.
You’re lucky to find a partner who knows it. People who say they know it and don’t
really are legion at the advanced-intermediate level.</p>

<section id="natural">
<h3>Natural<a class="headerlink" href="#natural" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>You can just play responder overcalls as natural, with two-level bids being competitive
and three-level bids game forcing. 2N is invitational showing a stopper.  Bidding their
suit (a <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-cue-bid"><span class="xref std std-term">cue bid</span></a>) is game-forcing Stayman.  However, over a 2♣ overcall you have
a double as Stayman.</p>

<section id="runouts">
<span id="runout"></span><span id="index-23"></span><h3>Runouts<a class="headerlink" href="#runouts" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>You also can agree on a system, called a “runout”, when your 1N opener gets doubled for
penalty. You’ve played 1N with a <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-yarborough"><span class="xref std std-term">yarborough</span></a> dummy before? You don’t want
to go there. Here’s the simplest way out.</p>
<p>After 1N (X) or 1N (Pass) Pass (X) Pass (Pass), responder has the following choices:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Pass if you are willing to play 1N doubled (typically a balanced hand with
at least competitive values).  This is often your best contract.</p></li>
<li><p>XX is a relay to clubs, pass or correct. If responder is weak, we’ll be
better off in any suit fit. If opener has just two clubs he could bid
diamonds instead; assuming he did not open with two doubletons, he has
at least three of each of the other suits.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="index-24">If their double does not show strength, but rather is something like
a double for a single-suited hand, responder with a strong hand may
pass and wait for the suit to be shown, or just bid normally. Generally delayed action,
when you could have taken immediate action, shows strength.</p>
<p>If responder initially passes, and the opponents bid a suit or suits,
responder’s double is penalty-oriented.</p>

<section id="unusual-2n-interference">
<span id="index-25"></span><h3>Unusual 2N interference<a class="headerlink" href="#unusual-2n-interference" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>1N (2N) is a very effective bid showing 5-5 in the minors. Against it, use the
<a class="reference internal" href="TwoSuitedDefense.html#defense-two-suited"><span class="std std-ref">General Defense to Two-Suited Bids</span></a>.</p>
<p>As the defender, you do not bid (1N) - 2N to show you have a notrump opener too – you
double for penalty. That’s why 2N is free to have a special meaning.</p>

<h2>What Partner May Want<a class="headerlink" href="#what-partner-may-want" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Partners may come with their own ideas. Here are some that you could agree to play
in good conscience:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1N - 3♣ and 3♦ as showing 5-5 in the minors (invitational and game-forcing
respectively).</p></li>
<li><p>1N - 3♥ and 3♠ showing 5-5 in the majors, similarly. See note below.</p></li>
<li><p>1N - 3♣ as a game forcing bid asking if you have a five-card major. There are two
forms of this, <a class="reference internal" href="AdvancedNotrump.html#fivecardstayman"><span class="std std-ref">Five Card Stayman</span></a>, preferred, and
<a class="reference internal" href="InterestingGadgets.html#id1"><span class="std std-ref">Puppet Stayman</span></a>, a convention normally played over 2N.
Actually, Five Card Stayman is what you want to play.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#stolenbids"><span class="std std-ref">Stolen Bids</span></a>. This is ok, but a dead end.
Learn <a class="reference internal" href="Lebensohl.html#lebensohl"><span class="std std-ref">Lebensohl</span></a> eventually.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternate <a class="reference internal" href="AdvancedRunouts.html#advancedrunouts"><span class="std std-ref">Advanced Runouts</span></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you don’t really need special bids for 5-5 in the majors, as explained
in <a class="reference internal" href="#responding55"><span class="std std-ref">Responding When 5-5</span></a>.</p>
