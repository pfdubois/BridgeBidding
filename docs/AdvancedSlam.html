<p>Slam bidding, especially in the minors, is really hard.  This chapter arms you for
battle.</p>
<section id="italian-control-bidding">
<span id="italian"></span><span id="index-0"></span><h2>Italian Control Bidding<a class="headerlink" href="#italian-control-bidding" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the Italian style, a control bid shows a first- <em>or</em> second-round
control. A second-round control can be shown without a first-control
having been shown in that suit. These rules are applied to interpret the
bids:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A control bid is a slam try after trump agreement in a major. It promises first- or
second-round control. (Again, over minors or in 2/1 these bids  also possible but
agreement is needed.)</p></li>
<li><p>A control bid is a non-jump bid in a game-forcing auction. Thus 1♠ - 2♠ - 3♦ is not
a control bid because we are not yet in a game forcing auction.
But 1♦ - 1♥ - 3♥ - 3♠! is a control bid because bidding on is game forcing and we
have suit agreement.</p></li>
<li><p>A control bid that skips a suit(s) denies a control in that suit. So 1♦ - 1♥ - 3♥ - 4♣
shows a club control and denies a spade control.</p></li>
<li><p>As long as slam is possible, always show a control bid below the game
level. Likewise, don’t control bid if partner has a limited hand and slam is not
possible.</p></li>
<li><p>A control bid in a 5+ card side suit promises the Ace or King. For
example, 1♠ - 2N! - 4♦ - 4♥ (control) - 5♦ shows the Ace or King of diamonds.
Opener’s suit must be a good suit or he would have bid his shortness, so being
able to show possession of the Ace or King is important.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you show a short suit, control-bid that suit only with a void,
not a singleton Ace. An example would be a Jacoby 2N auction, with opener rebidding
a stiff or void, such as 1♠ - 2N! - 3♦! (stiff or void) - 4♣ (control) - 4♦;
this shows opener has a void in diamonds.</p></li>
<li><p>A control bid at the five level promises first round control, because
4N is no longer available.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bergen gives this example of a five-level control bid:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  West   East

♠JT752  ♠AK643
♥AK982  ♥Q64
♦A4     ♦87
♣2      ♣AJT
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The bidding is:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>1♠ – 2N!
4♥ – 5♣ (not 4N here)
5♦ – 7♠
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The 4♥ bid shows a five-card suit with two of the top three honors. Therefore East knows
West has the AK in hearts. East makes the control-bid in clubs to give West a chance to
show the Ace of diamonds; for West to immediately bid 4N would be wrong because of the
worthless doubleton in diamonds. After knowing all suits are stopped, and foreseeing
setting up the hearts for a diamond discard, East can see the tricks for the 26 HCP grand
slam. We don’t promise this will happen to you, but it shows the power of the method.</p>
<p>Note that quite often preliminary control bids below the level of game allow us to bid 4N
where we otherwise could not, or to avoid getting to the five level when we don’t belong
here.</p>
<p>Bergen’s <cite>Better Slam Bidding</cite> and its workbook has excellent examples.</p>
<p class="rubric">Last Train</p>
<p>A modification to control bidding, “Last Train” (named after the Monkee’s hit,
“Last Train to Clarksville”, is an agreement that once trump has been established,
bidding the last strain before game says, “I have no more controls that I can show
you below game, but if you have extras, I do have interest in slam.”  This agreement
of course does not show or deny a control in the bid suit.</p>
<p>For example, after 1♠ - 3♠ - 4♣ (control), 4♥ would deny a control in diamonds but
show a hand that has slam interest but is not good enough to bid past 4♠ on its own.
It says nothing about a control in hearts.</p>
<p>The bid of course shows a control in any suit partner skipped over. For example,
1♠ - 3♠ - 4♦ - 4♥ shows a control in clubs but not necessarily in hearts.</p>
<p>The point of Last Train is to allow classifying your hand as having slam interest,
possible slam interest, or no slam interest by continuing past game, bidding Last Train,
or just bidding game.</p>

<h2>Five Notrump Pick-a-slam<a class="headerlink" href="#five-notrump-pick-a-slam" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-1"><span id="pick-a-slam"></span>When we have not agreed on a suit but you determine that the partnership has
the points to be in slam, a jump bid of 5N is a great alternative to just
shooting out 6N. It is much, much easier to make 12 tricks in a suit, even
a seven-card fit, than it is in no-trump.</p>
<p>In response, partner can suggest a suit to play in or bid 6N.</p>
<p>In particular, after an auction ending in
a quantitative 4N, bidding 5N is Pick-a-slam:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(2♥) 2N (P) 4N
(P)  5N(Pick A Slam)

<p id="index-2"><span id="id2"></span>Redwood is superior to <a class="reference internal" href="#id4"><span class="std std-ref">Minorwood</span></a>.</p>
<p>Redwood, or One-Over Keycard, is a <a class="reference internal" href="Slam.html#rkc"><span class="std std-ref">Roman Keycard</span></a> bid for the minors, that
leaves more room for responses.  The bid one over an agreed minor suit at the four level
asks for keycards in that minor: 4♦ for clubs, 4♥ for diamonds. The replies are 3014:</p>
<table class="docutils align-default" id="id5">

</table>
<p>After a 1st or 2nd step replay, bidding the next step asks about the trump Queen.
After any reply the bid of one over the trump suit asks for Kings. You should use
the number of Kings or the cheapest specific King, whatever you do for ordinary RKC.</p>
<p>When there is no explicit agreement, the one-over bid is not RKC if it could be
something else.  For example, 1♦ - 2♣ - 4♦ is not RKC for clubs.  In particular, if
4♥ could be natural, it is not RKC for diamonds. In that case, the two-over bid of
4♠ is the RKC bid; but you must check to be sure you have enough room for any feasible
reply.</p>
<p>Playing Redwood, 4N is never RKC.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>1♦ - 2♦(inverted or not) - 4♥!(RKC for diamonds) - 4N!(one or four)
1♠ - 2♦ - 4♥!(RKC for diamonds); implicit agreement
1♣ - 2♣ - 4♦!(RKC for clubs) - 4♠ - 4N to play
1♣ - 2♣ - 4N quantitative

</dd>
</dl>
<p>The One-Over Keycard idea can be also used for hearts:
a bid of 3♠ after an agreement on hearts is RKC. All responses are
just one lower than normal. Kickback is off if either partner has bid spades naturally
or bid Jacoby 2N; in the latter case the responses to J2NT take precedence.</p>
<p>These are kickback:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1♣ - 1♥ - 3♥ - 3♠!(Kickback)</p></li>
<li><p>1♥ - 2N! - 3♦!(shortness) - 3♠!(Kickback)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>but not:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1♠ - 2♥ - 3♥ - 3♠(natural)</p></li>
<li><p>1♥ - 2N! - 3♠!(shortness)</p></li>

<p>You can extend the agreement to cover more kinds of auctions, and cases of implicit

<section id="exclusion-blackwood">
<h2>Exclusion Blackwood<a class="headerlink" href="#exclusion-blackwood" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote id="exclusionblackwood">
<span id="index-4"></span><div><p>“I can’t believe I am writing this article. I wouldn’t recommend this convention to
anyone other than a full-time expert with a full-time regular partner. Still, it
is a sexy convention and I get asked about it all the time.”
– Larry Cohen</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Exclusion Blackwood is a way of asking for the number of Aces partner has except for the
one in a certain suit where the asker has a void. After an agreement on a trump suit,
a jump to one above what would be a splinter in a side suit asks for Aces outside that
suit. This is a jump to the five-level except when 3♠ would be a splinter; in that case
4♠ is Exclusion. You’re asking how many Aces partner has not counting the one in the suit
you jumped to.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>1♣ - 2♣!(inverted)
5♦!
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here 2♦ would be natural, 3♦ a jump-shift, and 4♦ a splinter in support of clubs. So 5♦
is Exclusion Blackwood and shows opener has a diamond void. The reply is based on the
number of Aces not counting the Ace of Diamonds. So the reply 5♠ says “1”.</p>
<p>With that expert regular partner you have, you might talk RKC or other response scales.</p>

<section id="preempt-keycard">
<h2>Preempt Keycard<a class="headerlink" href="#preempt-keycard" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-5"><span id="id3"></span>When partner makes a three-level preempt, a bid of 4♣ over a 3M preempt, or 4♦
over a 3♣ preempt, is Preempt Keycard. The point of the convention is to ask for
keycards but being able to stop in game.  To make this work there is
a special response set called 0-1-1-2-2, which means:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>First step no keycards</p></li>
<li><p>Second step one keycard</p></li>
<li><p>Third step one keycard with the Queen</p></li>
<li><p>Fourth step two keycards without the Queen</p></li>
<li><p>Fifth step two keycards with the Queen</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>3♥ - 4♣!(Preempt Keycard)
4♥(one keycard) - Pass
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We see that you should be willing to go to 5♥ if partner has one with the Queen or
better. A more accurate way to say this scale is 0 - 1 - 1.5 - 2 - 2.5.</p>
</section>
<section id="minorwood">
<h2>Minorwood<a class="headerlink" href="#minorwood" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-6"><span id="id4"></span>For a better alternative, see <a class="reference internal" href="#id2"><span class="std std-ref">Redwood</span></a>. I include this because it is
widely played.</p>
<p>An optional convention to use with inverted minors is “Minorwood”, a
jump to four of the minor after a two of a minor response. This becomes
Roman Keycard Blackwood for the minor. For example,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1♣ – 2♣!– 4♣!(asks for keycards)</p></li>
<li><p>1♣ – 2♣! - 2♥ – 4♣!(asks for keycards)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>but not in a non-jump sequence such as 1♣ – 2♣! - 2♥ – 3♦ – 4♣ in which the players
simply discover they lack a spade stopper and decide to play in clubs.</p>
<p>Except in the difference of RKC-asking bid, the convention proceeds as with Redwood,
the replies by steps.</p>
