<p id="index-0"><span id="minoropenings"></span>Our partner has opened 1♣ or 1♦. If we mean either we can write “1m”. Partner
could have a three-card suit but most of the time it is four or five cards. For
diamonds, only 5% of the time do we have only a three card suit.</p>
<p>So where are we going? If we don’t have 25 points or more, we want to stop in
the cheapest suitable contract we can find. If we have game strength, we hope
to find a 4-4 fit for a major, if possible, but more often our game, if we have
one, is 3NT. If they compete we might find a suit is unstopped. In that case we
may stop at 4 of a minor or press on to 5 of a minor, or even sometimes settle
for a 4-3 fit in a major.</p>
<p>In a possible slam exploration, the point at which we go past 3N is a point of
no return, and we should be thinking of the alternative to 3N as six of our
minor. Especially playing matchpoints, bidding five of a minor when a 3N
contract is making is a recipe for a bottom score.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>When an unpassed responder bids a new suit at the lowest level he can,
it is always forcing for one round.

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In this table (nf) means not forcing, (f) means forcing.</p></li>
<li><p>With a very strong hand, see “Looking For Slam”, below.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have hearts and spades of equal length, bid a heart.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no game forcing bid over 1♣.</p></li>
<li><p>1♦ - 2♣ requires five clubs, and is game forcing. Bid this first in preference to
showing a four-card major.</p></li>
<li><p>After a 1♦ - 3♣ invitation, <em>any</em> bid by opener is game forcing. Don’t try to
improve the part score.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no raise with a game-forcing hand. Bid a new suit if the 2/1 bid is not
available.</p></li>
<li><p>Bidding 1N does not promise a balanced hand or any particular stoppers. It simply
denies the other bids, and denies an invitational hand.</p></li>
<li><p>With less than a game-forcing hand you prefer to bid the major first rather than
a equally long or longer diamond suit.  Here’s an example:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>♠A4
♥9876
♦KQ762
♣97
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Partner opens 1♣. You bid 1♥. (If you had four spades as well, you’d still bid hearts,
up the line.)  The problem is that you can’t bid 1♦ and then try to show hearts later;
that would be a responder <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-reverse"><span class="xref std std-term">reverse</span></a> and show a game-forcing hand.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A new suit is forcing for one round. It is a general principle of 2/1 to always bid
your longest suit with a game force, including bidding 2♣ or 1♦ with five clubs and
a four-card major. You have plenty of time in a game-forcing auction to mention your
major.</p>
<p>The 1♦ - 3♣ bid being invitational rather than weak is a consequence of 1♦ - 2♣ being a
game force. One variant of 2/1 is to play that bidding 2♣ and then 3♣ on the next round
<em>cancels</em> the game force. That kind of loses the 2/1 spirit.</p>

<h3>Responding With A Game-Going Hand<a class="headerlink" href="#responding-with-a-game-going-hand" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>See the discussion of weak jump shifts in <a class="reference internal" href="JS.html#jump-shifts"><span class="std std-ref">All About Jump-Shifts</span></a>.
Unless we are playing strong jump-shifts, there is no game-forcing minor raise.
To force to game, responder has to keep making bids that cannot be passed short of
game, which in practice means bidding new suits.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="#inverted-minors"><span class="std std-ref">Inverted Minors</span></a> convention helps alleviate this problem.
Inverted Minors is one of the
<a class="reference internal" href="Preliminaries.html#expected-conventions"><span class="std std-ref">expected conventions with 2/1</span></a>.</p>
<p>If you cannot get to 3N you may need to stop in 4m or 5m; 5m has to usually include
around 29 points.</p>
<div class="admonition note" id="index-1">

<p>Bypassing a diamond suit to show a major is a style of bidding called <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-Walsh"><span class="xref std std-term">Walsh</span></a>.
With less than game-forcing holdings one bypasses
even five diamonds over partner’s 1♣ to show the major. This book assumes this style.</p>

<section id="looking-for-slam">
<h3>Looking For Slam<a class="headerlink" href="#looking-for-slam" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Bidding minor slams is awkward. Until you have agreed on a suit, 4N is not
<a class="reference internal" href="Slam.html#id2"><span class="std std-ref">Blackwood</span></a> (an Ace-asking bid). Jumping to five of the minor is
not inviting to slam, it is just shutting down with a distributional hand. All you
can do is bid as if you seek only game, and then keep going if you’re positive a slam
is likely. Going past 3N is crossing the Rubicon.</p>
<p>Absent any other agreement, 1m - 4m should not be a preemptive bid – it should be
a strong bid with a very good long suit, interested in 6m.  Partner can explore for
slam using the techniques in <a class="reference internal" href="Slam.html#slam-bidding"><span class="std std-ref">Slam Bidding</span></a> or sign off in 5m.
See <a class="reference internal" href="Preempts.html#gambling3n"><span class="std std-ref">Gambling 3N</span></a> for handling long solid suits when that’s <em>all</em>
you have.</p>
<p>The situation can be improved by playing <a class="reference internal" href="#inverted-minors"><span class="std std-ref">Inverted Minors</span></a>
and <a class="reference internal" href="AdvancedSlam.html#id2"><span class="std std-ref">Redwood</span></a> but it is never easy.  In most cases if the slam is not
clear-cut most of the field is not going to know how to get there so there is less
pressure to bid it.</p>

<section id="opener-s-rebid">
<h2>Opener’s Rebid<a class="headerlink" href="#opener-s-rebid" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Opener’s second bid is called his rebid. Choosing it depends on what responder bid.
It is opener’s turn to classify his hand (after revaluing it considering partner’s
response):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>up to 14 is a “minimum” hand; we don’t have a game if partner has less than
invitational values.</p></li>
<li><p>15 - 17 is <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-game-try"><span class="xref std std-term">game try</span></a> territory. We <em>might</em> have a game. More about that later.
But note that opener must be unbalanced or they would have opened 1N.</p></li>
<li><p>18 - 19 is almost enough for game even if responder has a minimum. We are anxious to
show this by rebidding 2N if possible.</p></li>
<li><p>20-21 is game forcing. We might even be in a slam hunt.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Minor openings often lead to the following scenario: responder bids a major,
and opener rebids 1N or a third suit. Responder has promised four cards in his
major, but he might have more.</p>
<p>Responder who has a five-card major would like to
ask the opener whether opener has three-card support; and when responder might hold
four cards in the other major, he’d also like to know if opener does too. Finding
out if we have a major fit is our most important goal.</p>
<p>Responder’s conventional second bids that ask about major holdings called
<a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-checkback"><span class="xref std std-term">checkback</span></a>, and the two basic ones are
<a class="reference internal" href="Checkback.html#fsf"><span class="std std-ref">Fourth Suit Forcing</span></a> when opener has rebid a new suit, and
<a class="reference internal" href="Checkback.html#nmf"><span class="std std-ref">New Minor Forcing</span></a> when opener has rebid 1N or 2N. Those are detailed in
the next chapter. To make those bids responder will have to be invitational or better.</p>
<section id="the-auction-1m-1m">
<h3>The Auction 1m - 1M<a class="headerlink" href="#the-auction-1m-1m" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>If responder has bid a major M, and opener has four in that major, he will
raise. Responder has an unlimited hand; all we know is that he has six or more points.
So opener can raise to 2M at least, and 4M if he has 19+ points (because 19 + 6 are 25).
The 3M bid says, partner, if you’ve got something more than six, say nine, take us
to game or start looking for slam if appropriate. Opener has a good 15 to 17 points.</p>
<p class="rubric">Opener Unbalanced</p>
<p>With an unbalanced hand that does not have four of partner’s major, opener should
bid 1♠ over 1♥ with four spades, bid an unbid suit, or rebid his opening
suit.  The unbid suit might not be possible if it is a reverse and opener does not
have sufficient strength.  For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>♠92
♥87
♦AKT7
♣KQJT4
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>After 1♣ - 1M, opener cannot bid 2♦ lacking the 17+ points a reverse would need. So
he bids 2♣. This is why some choose to open such a hand 1♦, and then rebid 2♣.
Ideally a 2♣ rebid shows six cards.</p>
<p>With enough to reverse, there would be no problem, just show the second suit.</p>
<p>If responder has bid a major and we have three of them and either a
singleton or no other good bid, we can raise. Mike Lawrence gives this example:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>♠ 52
♥ QJ9
♦ AJ763
♣ KQ4
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>After 1♦ - 1♥, he recommends 2♥. If you bid 1N expect a spade lead and your goose may
be well done. That diamond suit does not merit a rebid.</p>
<p>Once opener has made a three-card raise, which responder thinks is a four-card raise,
opener can bid NT at his next bid, if he gets one, to show this. Playing in a 4-3 fit
is not the end of the world.</p>
<p>So, to sum up, with an unbalanced hand, after 1m - 1M the priorities are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Raise partner;</p></li>
<li><p>Bid 1♠, forcing unless parter is a passed hand;</p></li>
<li><p>Bid a second suit of four cards or longer; or,</p></li>
<li><p>Rebid your suit if you don’t have the strength for that;</p></li>
<li><p>Jump-rebid your suit with 15-17 points</p></li>
<li><p>Jump-shift with 18-19+. (Jump-shifts by <em>opener</em> are never weak). Game forcing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="rubric">Opener Balanced</p>
<p>With a minimum balanced hand, opener will rebid 1N if he cannot raise or bid 1♠.
He doesn’t make a three-card raise, because if responder has
invitational or better values and really does have five cards in M, he will
checkback with <a class="reference internal" href="Checkback.html#nmf"><span class="std std-ref">New Minor Forcing</span></a>.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>If opener rebids 1N he promises a <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-balanced"><span class="xref std std-term">balanced</span></a> hand.
Never rebid 1N with a singleton or void.</p>
</div>
<p>This rule, which I jokingly call the Prime Directive, is so important because of the
conclusions partner can draw. For example, suppose responder has six hearts and
hears opener rebid 1N. Responder now knows he has an 8- or 9-card heart fit.
An opener who is 4=1=4=4 is going to be shocked to hear a 4♥ bid.</p>
<p>The priorities therefore are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Raise partner;</p></li>
<li><p>Bid 1♠, forcing</p></li>
<li><p>Bid 1N with a balanced minimum hand.</p></li>
<li><p>Bid 2N with a balanced 18-19 HCP.  This does not deny any major you may skip over:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1♦ - 1♥ - 2N does not deny having four spades</p></li>
<li><p>1♦ - 1♠ - 2N does not deny having four hearts</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Bid 3N with 20-21 points.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The system we use after <a class="reference internal" href="NoTrump.html#strong1n"><span class="std std-ref">opening a notrump</span></a>
does not apply after we <em>rebid</em> 1N and likewise the system
<a class="reference internal" href="TwoNT.html#open2n"><span class="std std-ref">after we *open* 2N</span></a> does not apply after a 2N <em>rebid</em>. Those systems
only apply when we open or <em>overcall</em> in notrump.</p>
</div>
<p class="rubric">Bypass 1♠?</p>
<p>Is it ever ok to bid 1N rather than 1♠, if your hand is balanced? Experts sometimes do.
Gavin Wolpert gives two cases where he would. First, he’s 4=3=3=3. Second, he has
a hand that is say 4=2=3=4, with say ♦AQJ, after 1♣ - 1♥ – fearing that if he bids 1♠,
partner won’t be able to bid 1N fearing he has no diamond stopper.  In both cases, Gavin
is willing to lose the spade suit when his partner is not strong enough to check back,
in order to get to 1N if it is right.</p>
<p>The downside is that the opener with four spades will never believe we have a fit.</p>

<section id="the-auction-1-1-1n">
<h3>The Auction 1♣ - 1♦ - 1N<a class="headerlink" href="#the-auction-1-1-1n" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This auction is special because opener should bid 1N even though they have a four-card
major. The reason is that if responder bids a major now, it is game forcing.
With a less-than-game-forcing hand, responder would have skipped over 1♦ to bid the
major.</p>
<p>If that isn’t what is going on, we’re basically done unless responder has a
game forcing hand. If not, responder can bid a suit preference to clubs, bid 2♦
with five of them, or pass, bid 2N, or bid 3N as appropriate.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-auction-1-2-game-forcing">
<h3>The Auction 1♦ - 2♣ Game Forcing<a class="headerlink" href="#the-auction-1-2-game-forcing" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Partner has made a game-forcing bid promising five clubs. We’re looking for 3N
initially. Notice that responder will only have a four-card major if they have
longer clubs. What follows is the scheme suggested by Gavin Wolpert. Opener’s
rebids are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>2♦ shows 5+ diamonds, any strength. Does not deny a four-card major. If partner
has one we will hear about it next and can raise it.</p></li>
<li><p>2♥ or 2♠ shows a 4-card major, denies five diamonds.
Because we are in a game-forcing auction, this
is not a <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-reverse"><span class="xref std std-term">reverse</span></a>, so does not require extra strength.</p></li>
<li><p>3♣ shows 3+ clubs. This doesn’t settle the question
of strain: we still wish we could find 3N rather than 5♣. Time to show stoppers.</p></li>
<li><p>3♦ shows 6+ diamonds, at most one loser in diamonds, and 16+ HCP.</p></li>
<li><p>3♥, 3♠ are <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-splinter"><span class="xref std std-term">splinter</span></a> bids, with 4+ clubs.</p></li>
<li><p>2N is natural, balanced with 12-14 or 18-19 HCP.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, all these are forcing to 3N or 4 of a minor.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The only auction where 2♥ is unbalanced is when opener’s hand is 4=4=4=1.</p></li>
<li><p>Opener’s splinters shows a nine-card fit but does not show extra values. This is
also a general principle of 2/1 auctions. We will discuss more of these principles
in the section on 2/1 auctions for a major.</p></li>

<h3>The Auction 1m - 1N<a class="headerlink" href="#the-auction-1m-1n" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>After 1m - 1N, bidding 2N is 18-19 HCP. You don’t deny a four-card major but
you know responder hasn’t got one.  Responder sometimes has a bad 6 HCP so
it is best not to jump to 3N. Otherwise, a reverse or jump-shift here is forcing for
a round.</p>

<section id="subsequent-bidding">
<h2>Subsequent Bidding<a class="headerlink" href="#subsequent-bidding" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-2">If responder has bid a major, and opener does not have four cards in it, there might
still be a 3-5 major fit.  Or, there might be a four-four fit in the other major,
for example when responder has five spades and four hearts but opener has
two spades and four hearts.</p>
<p>Two <a class="reference internal" href="Preliminaries.html#expected-conventions"><span class="std std-ref">expected conventions</span></a> that solve the problem of
detecting such fits are covered in the next chapter,
<a class="reference internal" href="AdvancedCB.html#checkback"><span class="std std-ref">Basic Checkback</span></a>: New Minor Forcing and Fourth Suit Forcing.</p>
<p>Over a 1N rebid, responder’s natural second bid is not forcing.
The most commonly misunderstood of these is 1m - 1♠ - 1N - 2♥. This is a new suit by
an unpassed hand but it is NOT forcing. If responder now bids 2♠, that’s just
agreeing to play spades rather than hearts. The chapter on NMF covers all the
non-conventional bids after 1N as well.</p>
<p>When opener is unbalanced, the responder must make sure we get to game if we have
the values. If we agree on a minor suit, the usual issue is, do we have stoppers for
an NT contract.  When there are two unbid suits, bidding one SHOWS a stopper and
denies a stopper in the other; while bidding NT shows stoppers in both:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>1♣ - 1♦
2♦ - 2♠
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>shows a spade stopper, and the values for 3N, but no heart stopper. Opener will bid
some number of diamonds without a heart stopper, depending on strength.</p>
<p>In case of a straight raise, 1m - 2m, opener bids a new suit at the two level as a
<a class="reference internal" href="OpenerRebid.html#hsgt"><span class="std std-ref">Help Suit Game Try</span></a>.  After 1m - 3m, bid stoppers up the line to
accept the game try. The first partner who knows we have all three suits stopped bids
3N.</p>

<p id="index-3"><span id="minor-interference"></span>A minor is so easy to overcall, it happens a lot, so we must be prepared.
Responder’s bids over the overcall mean
what they would have meant, except that the limit raise or better is shown
with a <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-cue-bid"><span class="xref std std-term">cue bid</span></a>. That’s a bid of <em>their</em> suit, such as 1♣ - (1♥) - 2♥.
That has the same meaning as 1♣ - 3♣.</p>
<p>A cue bid at the three level after partner’s 1m opener is overcalled is
<a class="reference internal" href="Tools.html#id1"><span class="std std-ref">Western Cue</span></a>, asking partner to bid 3N with a stopper in
their suit. A Wester Cue bids says, “We have the points for game, partner, but I do not
have a stopper.  I probably have something to help though.”</p>
<p>Worst case is they have a nine-card fit in a major suit.  Without two good stoppers 3N
will be a very poor contract.</p>
<p>If they double, the bid 2N! becomes an artificial bid showing a limit raise or
better (<a class="reference internal" href="MajorOpenings.html#jordan2nt"><span class="std std-ref">Jordan 2NT</span></a>. When you don’t have a suitable bid but do have
10+ HCP, you can use a <a class="reference internal" href="Doubles.html#blood"><span class="std std-ref">Going For Blood</span></a> redouble.</p>

<section id="index-4">
<span id="inverted-minors"></span><span id="id1"></span><h2>Inverted Minors<a class="headerlink" href="#index-4" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Inverted Minors is listed as one of the
<a class="reference internal" href="Preliminaries.html#expected-conventions"><span class="std std-ref">expected conventions</span></a> for a 2/1 player but you can
not play it without a lot of harm.</p>
<p>Inverted Minors is off in competition but on by a passed hand.</p>
<p>The convention simply makes a single raise a better hand than a double raise.
1m - 2m! requires:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>10+ points</p></li>
<li><p>5+ cards in the minor, or four really good ones if it is diamonds.</p></li>
<li><p>No four card major</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The 2m bid must be alerted. It is forcing for one round. In competition,
2m reverts to its standard meaning. If 3m is a jump, as in 1♦ - (1♥) - 3♦, it
is weak.</p>
<p>After a strong raise, the partners bid stoppers up-the-line. While some do not
look to confirm a stopper in the other minor, we do. The first party that
knows we have stoppers bids 2N, or a responder with a game-forcing hand can
go directly to 3N. “He who knows, goes”, as Marty Bergen says. If 3N or 6m
is not possible we will head for 5m.  Stopping in 4m is possible but if 3N makes
expect a score of 0%.</p>
<p>Some experts prefer to use 3m as a “mixed” raise, showing 7-10 HCP, so that an
opener with 18-19 points can bid 3N, but that won’t be what your partner means unless
they bring it up.</p>
