<p>The Lebensohl idea is perhaps the key idea of advanced bidding. This idea is
applicable in a wide variety of competitive situations, but
we begin by learning it as a way of dealing with interference over a 1N
opener. It can also be used after partner doubles a 2-level preempt or
when opponents interfere over a 2♣ opener, or after an opener’s reverse, and in other
competitive situations.  We cover the other situations later.</p>
<p>What these seemingly different situations have in common is that
a bidder has to differentiate different hand types but is running out of room to do
so at a reasonable level. While frequently the word Lebensohl is used to refer to
a bid of 2N relaying to 3♣, that’s really a misuse.  Rather, 2N as a relay to 3♣ is
the signature bid of an idea.</p>
<p>A variant, Transfer Lebensohl, is becoming popular
among experts. A lesson on it is available from Gavin Wolpert at wolpertbridge.com.</p>
<p>There never was a player named Lebensohl, and Kenneth Lebensold, who got the credit
at one time, denies having created it. So arguably the convention should be spelled
lebensohl.</p>
<section id="lebensohl-after-we-open-1n">
<h2>Lebensohl After We Open 1N<a class="headerlink" href="#lebensohl-after-we-open-1n" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since life will usually be easy for us after we open 1N, opponents are motivated to
interfere.  That uses up the room we need to decide our <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-strain"><span class="xref std std-term">strain</span></a> and level.
Lebensohl gives up one natural reply in order to effectively double the remaining
bidding space.</p>
<p>Suppose we open 1N and this is overcalled. Of course, if responder
is weak they need do nothing. But what if responder is competitive or better?</p>
<p>For example, suppose responder has a good 5(or more) card suit and enough
values that he wishes to compete for a part-score or a game. Consider this bidding
sequence:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>1N (2♥) 3♣
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Imagine responder has one of these two hands:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>♠xxx ♥xx ♦Jx ♣KQxxxx</p></li>
<li><p>♠AQx ♥xx ♦Jx ♣KQxxxx</p></li>
</ol>
<p>With (1), responder would like to have the contract be 3♣. With (2), responder would
like to force to game, probably 3N or 5♣, depending on opener’s heart holding.</p>
<p>The one bid 3♣ cannot mean both kinds of hands. It is ambiguous. How do we come
up with a way to express these different hands?</p>
<p>We will use 2N, called the Lebensohl 2N. It is an artificial bid and is alerted as
a <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-relay"><span class="xref std std-term">relay</span></a> to 3♣. It is called a relay rather than a transfer because the bidder
is not promising he has clubs.</p>
<p>After we bid 2N!(relay), partner must bid 3♣. Then we can make a three-level
bid. So there are two ways, for example, to bid 3♦ over 1N (2♥):</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Bid 2N!(relay) and after opener bids 3♣, bid 3♦, or;</p></li>
<li><p>Bid 3♦ right away.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So we can use (1) for hand 1, and (2) for hand 2.  We have “disambiguated” the 3♦ bid.</p>
<p>Bidding immediately over their overcall is called a “fast” bid; going through
the relay first is the “slow” bid.</p>
<p>The reason people feel Lebensohl is complicated is that bids have different meanings
depending on what suit we have and what suit was overcalled.</p>
<section id="over-two-level-overcalls">
<h3>Over Two-Level Overcalls<a class="headerlink" href="#over-two-level-overcalls" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p class="rubric">When Lebensohl Is Off</p>
<p>If the intervenor makes a bid showing two definite suits,
we don’t use Lebensohl. See
<a class="reference internal" href="#lebensohl2suits"><span class="std std-ref">Artificial Overcalls</span></a>, below.</p>
<p>If the overcall was in clubs, or intervenor doubled, Lebensohl is off. Systems are on.
Systems on means we use our normal bids, as if they had not bid. Double is
Stayman, 2♦ is a transfer to hearts, and so on.</p>
<p>This is also true when they make an artificial 2♣ bid or an artificial double promising
one long suit.</p>
<p>If they doubled for penalty, it is a <a class="reference internal" href="NoTrump.html#runout"><span class="std std-ref">runout</span></a> situation.</p>
<p class="rubric">Over Artificial Bids Showing One Definite Suit</p>
<p>When the intervenor has made a bid that shows one definite suit and an unknown
second suit, we ignore the second suit for the moment and proceed as if they
had bid the known suit. For example, a Cappelletti 2♥ bid shows “hearts and a
minor”. We’ll react as if it was just hearts. A D.O.N.T. bid of 2♦ shows
“diamonds and a major”. We’ll react as if it was just diamonds.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1N (2♣! long suit) system is on, double is Stayman;</p></li>
<li><p>1N (2♣ natural) system is on, double is Stayman;</p></li>
<li><p>1N (2♣! clubs and spades) use two-suited defense, not Lebensohl;</p></li>
<li><p>1N (2♣! clubs and a higher) treat as a club bid, so system is on;</p></li>
<li><p>1N (2♦! diamonds and a higher) treat as Lebensohl for diamonds;</p></li>
<li><p>1N (2♣! a minor or both majors) system is on, double is Stayman;</p></li>
<li><p>1N (2♥! hearts and a minor) treat as Lebensohl for hearts;</p></li>
<li><p>1N (X) use our runout system</p></li>
<li><p>1N (X! long suit) system is on, redouble is Stayman.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="rubric">Over 2♦, 2♥, or 2♠</p>
<p>Over their two-level overcall of 2♦, 2♥, or 2♠ (or a bid showing that suit and another
unknown suit):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A two-level suit bid is non-forcing (“to play”).</p></li>
<li><p>A three-level suit bid is game-forcing (fast bid).</p></li>
<li><p>A bid of 2N!(relay to 3♣) forces opener to bid 3♣. Now responder:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Can pass with a weak hand with long clubs;</p></li>
<li><p>Bid a suit of lower rank than the overcall as a signoff (slow bid); or</p></li>
<li><p>Bid a suit of a higher rank than the overcall as invitational.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that a direct three-level bid might be a jump (e.g. 1N - (2♥) - 3♠) but it
isn’t weak because if you were weak you could have just passed.</p>
<p>Further, if responder has a game-forcing hand he can show other hand types besides a
suit of his own:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>An immediate bid of 3N over the overcall denies an unbid four-card major and denies
a stopper.</p></li>
<li><p>A “slow” 3N bid denies an unbid four-card major and shows a stopper.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>One can also still make normal bids at the four-level.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>4♣ is Gerber.</p></li>
<li><p>4♦! and 4♥! are Texas Transfers to hearts and spades,
showing six card suits and values for game only. With a strong hand and a
six-card major game-force at the three level first.</p></li>
<li><p>4♠! (rare) invites opener to pick a minor game.</p></li>
<li><p>4N is invitational to 6N and of course promises a stopper.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The sharp-eyed reader will have noticed that there is no way to invite in notrump
(we gave it up for the Lebensohl 2N), and there is no way to invite in a suit of
lower-rank than the overcall. When
responder has a higher-ranked suit he has three ways to bid it, e.g.:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>2S – to play</p></li>
<li><p>2N relay then 3S – invitational</p></li>
<li><p>3S – game-forcing</p></li>
</ul>
<p>But when the responder’s suit is lower-ranked, the 2-level bid does not exist,
so the relay has to mean the “to play” bid and we just don’t have an
invitational bid.</p>
<p class="rubric">Stayman</p>
<p id="index-1">In standard bidding, without Lebensohl, a cue bid of the overcalled suit is
Stayman. For example, 1N (2♦) 3♦ is Stayman. Obviously you need a game-forcing
hand.</p>
<p>There is a twist to the normal Stayman pattern, however.
Suppose opener replies spades but you have four hearts and not four spades. Can
you now bid 3N without a stopper in their suit?  If opener had neither major,
can he bid 3N without a stopper? It’s ambiguous.  Sounds like a job for
Lebensohl:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>An “fast” <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-cue-bid"><span class="xref std std-term">cue bid</span></a> is Stayman and denies a stopper in their suit.</p></li>
<li><p>A “slow” cue bid is Stayman and shows a stopper. (“Slow shows”).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After this the Stayman dance is modified in obvious ways. For example,
in these auctions, opener without a four-card major will have to bid:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>3N if he has no unbid four-card major and either has a diamond stopper or was
promised one by responder, or</p></li>
<li><p>4♣ to show responder that we lack a major fit or a diamond stopper.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="rubric" id="index-2">Double</p>
<p>So what does double mean in a Lebensohl situation?  E.g., 1N (2♥) X?</p>
<p>It is possible to play X as penalty-oriented. However, a
newer approach is to play a double as a negative double. The hope is to be able to
find fits with invitational hands, which are not sufficiently strong for the
Stayman cue bids.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>You must be clear with your partner which version of double you are playing</p>
</div>
<p class="rubric">Examples</p>
<p>Five-card suit:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1N (2♦) 2♥ is to play</p></li>
<li><p>1N (2♦) 2N! - 3♣! - 3♥ is invitational</p></li>
<li><p>1N (2♦) 3♥ is game-forcing.</p></li>
<li><p>1N (2♥) 2N! - 3♦ is to play</p></li>
<li><p>1N (2♥) 3♦ is game-forcing; there is no way to invite in diamonds.</p></li>
<li><p>1N (2♣) 2♦ is a transfer to hearts. (Lebensohl is off for clubs!)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Balanced hand, without a four-card major:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1N (2♦) 2N! - 3♣ - 3N  is to play, diamonds are stopped – slow shows.</p></li>
<li><p>1N (2♦) 3N  wants to play 3N but does not have a diamond stopper.
Opener will pass if he has one, or start suggesting suits up the line.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the Stayman cases:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1N (2♦) X is negative, probably with only an invitational hand.</p></li>
<li><p>1N (2♦) 3♦ is Stayman without a stopper, and</p></li>
<li><p>1N (2♦) 2N! - 3♣ - 3♦ is Stayman with a stopper.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Do not call the 2N bid by itself “Lebensohl”.
Lebensohl is the entire system described in this chapter. The 2N bid

<section id="two-suited-overcalls">
<span id="lebensohl2suits"></span><h3>Two-Suited Overcalls<a class="headerlink" href="#two-suited-overcalls" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>If their overcall shows two definite suits, Lebensohl is off. I like to use the
spirit of the <a class="reference internal" href="TwoSuitedDefense.html#defense-two-suited"><span class="std std-ref">General Defense To Two-Suited Bids</span></a>,
letting the invisible cue bids show a game-forcing bid of responder’s suit
using the lower-lower concept, and letting double show a penalty double of one
of their suits. Bidding one of “our” two suits naturally is to play if we can
bid it at the 2-level.</p>
<p>When we speak of the overcalled suit or suits, we mean the ones their bid
<em>showed</em>, not the artificial one actually bid. E.g. a Cappelletti 2♦ meaning
“both majors” makes the two major suits “theirs” and diamonds is one of “ours”.</p>
<p>Doubling says you have a penalty double in at least one of their suits.</p>
<p>Rodwell in <cite>Lebensohl</cite> (See <a class="reference internal" href="Resources.html#resources"><span class="std std-ref">Resources</span></a>) has a more
complicated scheme.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="lebensohl-after-doubles-of-weak-two-bids">
<span id="index-4"></span><span id="index-3"></span><span id="lebensohl-applications"></span><h2>Lebensohl After Doubles Of Weak Two Bids<a class="headerlink" href="#lebensohl-after-doubles-of-weak-two-bids" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>When an opponent opens a weak two bid, and our partner doubles it, he usually
shows a decent opening hand with shortness in their suit. The double is
presumed to be for takeout but it could be a strong hand. For other
bids see <a class="reference internal" href="CompetingSuit.html#competingpreempts"><span class="std std-ref">Competing Over Preempts</span></a>. Assuming
for the moment that the responder passes, we must classify our hand into weak,
positive response, or game-forcing.</p>
<p>Eric Rodwell suggested in his Lebensohl pamphlet that the borders of the “positive
response” be 6-10 points. Gavin Wolpert says 8-11 points.</p>
<p>Consider an auction that begins (2♥) X (P) ? where the advancer holds a hand with
six diamonds. Absent some agreement, advancer with a hand that is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Weak – wants to bid diamonds and have partner pass</p></li>
<li><p>Positive – wants to bid diamonds and hope partner bids again</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A bid of 3♦ cannot tell two different stories. Once again, the Lebensohl
concept solves the problem. If you do not play this convention you’ll have to
let the 3-level bids be weak.</p>
<section id="lebensohl-over-weak-twos">
<h3>Lebensohl Over Weak Twos<a class="headerlink" href="#lebensohl-over-weak-twos" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>If the suit that we want to bid, y, is of lower rank than the preempt, we are
going to have to bid it at the three level. Going through 2N!(relay) Lebesohl
shows the weaker hands.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>2N! is a relay to 3♣, pass or correct.</p></li>
<li><p>Immediate 3-level bids are positive responses.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When the suit we want to bid, y, is higher-ranked than the preempt suit, we have three
bids available.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>An immediate 2y shows the weak hand.</p></li>
<li><p>2N! followed by 3y shows a positive response with 4 cards in y.</p></li>
<li><p>An immediate 3y shows a positive response with 5(or more) cards in y.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>2♥ X P 2♠ = weak hand</p></li>
<li><p>2♥ X P 3♠ = positive with five spades</p></li>
<li><p>2♥ X P 2N!; P 3♣! P 3♠ positive with four spades</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The relay does not have to be accepted if the doubler had a strong hand. This is
called “breaking” the relay.</p>
<p>This meaning of 3y is current “expert standard” according to Wolpert.
If you are new to Lebensohl it isn’t going to kill you to just use the direct 3-level
bid for any positive response for consistency with the other case.</p>
</section>
<section id="game-forcing-hands">
<h3>Game Forcing Hands<a class="headerlink" href="#game-forcing-hands" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>What if we want to force to game but, allowing for the fact that
partner may not have four of an unbid major, can we do better than just bidding
4M and hoping? Our only other tool is to bid their suit.</p>
<p>For example, over 2♥ X P, suppose we have a game forcing hand with ♠AQx. We aren’t
sure where we belong, be it 4♠, 3N, or perhaps 5m. Again, we use the 2N relay to
double the language available:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The direct “fast” cue bid shows we do not have four of the other major but are forcing
to game.</p></li>
<li><p>The “slow” 2N relay before the cue bid shows 4(or more) cards of the other
major and forcing to game but no stopper.</p></li>
<li><p>2N relay and then 3N also shows 4 cards in the other major but with a stopper,
offering a choice of games.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Again, if you are new to this, it isn’t going to kill you to cue bid to show the
game force or just bid 4 of the other major when you don’t have a stopper.  A seven-card
fit won’t be the end of the world.</p>
<p class="rubric">Notes</p>
<p>There is one more scenario that should be considered Lebensohl:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(1x) X (2x) ?
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where x is not clubs. This is similar to (2x) X (P) ? Thus, play 2N here as
the Lebensohl relay.  A double is a <a class="reference internal" href="SpecialDoubles.html#responsive-double"><span class="std std-ref">responsive</span></a>.</p>
<p>Be careful not to just count points when distinguishing a positive vs. a game-forcing
reply.  If you have five cards in your major, especially, you might want to upgrade.</p>
<p id="index-5">You can make also play Better Minor Lebensohl in this scenario. Statistically it pays,
but requires you to remember it and gives up differentiating weak and positive
hands with clubs.</p>
<p>After the 2N!(relay) bid, the person responding to it bids their better minor
suit rather than always bidding clubs. This has the advantage of finding a
better minor suit fit when the 2N bidder has both minors.  Obviously in the
case of holding a hand with long diamonds, you just correct to diamonds or
hearts over 3♣, but you can’t correct 3♦ to clubs so you just can’t bid the
relay. The direct 3♣ response to the double has to be assumed to be weak.</p>

<span id="index-6"></span><h2>When They Overcall Our Two Club Opener<a class="headerlink" href="#when-they-overcall-our-two-club-opener" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The auction 2♣ (2♥) is similar to 1N (2♥). We have the same dilemma of
wanting to compete but not wanting to confuse partner as to our hand
strength. Lebensohl can be used in these situations. If opponents play
2♣ (X) as showing the majors we would treat that as a two-suited bid in
hearts and spades.</p>
</section>
<section id="lebensohl-over-reverses">
<span id="index-7"></span><h2>Lebensohl Over Reverses<a class="headerlink" href="#lebensohl-over-reverses" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Imagine this headache: partner opens 1♣, you bid 1♠ with a minimal
four-card holding, and partner reverses with 2♥. This is forcing for one
round. What to do? If you had five spades you could just bid 2♠. But
let’s say you don’t, but you do prefer clubs or have five diamonds you
by-passed in order to show your four-card major.</p>
<p>If you just bid 3♣ as a preference, that’s ok – until the next time when
you have a better hand and can’t bid 3♣ because the partnership has
decided it is to play. Hmm. This sounds familiar – it is the same ambiguity
as 1N (2♥) 3♣ – what does it mean? And the dilemma has the same solution –
Lebensohl.</p>
<p>So, for example, a direct bid of 3♣ over a 2♥ reverse is game-forcing. A
“slow” trip to 3♣ via 2N, lets you pass and stop there.</p>

<h2>Simplified Lebensohl<a class="headerlink" href="#simplified-lebensohl" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you do not feel comfortable with full Lebensohl, use this simpler version of
it.  It covers most responder hand types.</p>
<p>The opposition has bid a suit 2♦, 2♥, or 2♠ over our 1N opener.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Double is penalty-oriented with at least two cards in their suit.</p></li>
<li><p>Two-level suit bids are to play</p></li>

<h2>Good - Bad 2N<a class="headerlink" href="#good-bad-2n" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-9"><span id="index-8"></span>This Lebensohl variant is explained most fully in Larry Cohen’s “To Bid Or Not To Bid”
and in Marty Bergen’s “Better Bidding With Bergen”.</p>
<p>In a competitive auction, it is your turn to bid and RHO has just bid 2x, whether as
a raise of his partner or a new suit, after your partner doubled or made an
overcall.  For example, let’s suppose the auction went (1♥) - 1♠ - (2♥).  Suppose you
have a good diamond suit but no spade support.  Then what does your 3♦ bid show?
Most of the time of course you’re just trying to compete but other times you have a
extras and partner may wish to go higher knowing that.</p>
<p>Enter the Good - Bad 2N, created by Larry Cohen in his book “To Bid Or Not To Bid”.
Whenever we are in a competitive suit auction and our RHO has made a 2-level bid, 2N! is a
relay to 3♣, pass or correct.  Bidding directly on the three level shows extras.</p>
<p>Take for example this auction:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(1♠) 2♦ (2♠) ?
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Without an agreement, a 3♦ bid here is hard to read. With Good - Bad 2N, 3♦ might be
a good four-card diamond suit with 9 points, while 2N!(relay) - 3♣!(forced) - 3♦ might be
only six points and partner will know not to compete further.</p>
<p>This convention also applies when you opened:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>1♥(you) (2♣) Pass (2♠)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you have a two-suiter in hearts and diamonds, you want to distinguish 3♦ giving
partner a choice vs. 3♦ showing something like an 18-point 5-5 hand.</p>
<p>You must draw inferences when partner does not use the relay when he could have.</p>
<p>With some experience, you can use the Good - Bad distinction in many other competitive
auctions.  According to “Better Bidding With Bergen”, it is important that this convention
be off in situations such as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>where 2N is clearly Unusual 2N</p></li>
<li><p>when either side has opened 1N</p></li>
<li><p>when the opponents opened a strong 1♣!.</p></li>
<li><p>when the opponents have made a penalty double</p></li>
<li><p>when we have already found a fit</p></li>
<li><p>when we are already in a game-forcing auction.</p></li>
</ul>
