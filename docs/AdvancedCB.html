<p id="index-0">The Checkback Family is New Minor Forcing (NMF), Fourth Suit Forcing, and XYZ.
NMF has a variant, Two-Way New Minor Forcing (TWNMF). The first two conventions were
covered previously; TWNMF is described in detail in this chapter.</p>
<p>Two-way New Minor Forcing (TWNMF), also called Two-Way Checkback Stayman, distinguishes
invitational vs. game-forcing hands by using both 2♣ and 2♦ as artificial and is close to
universally used amongst experts instead of NMF.</p>
<p>XYZ extends the idea of TWNMF to the case of the opener’s rebid being 1♠, and
is so-named because the auction has begun 1x - 1y - 1z. Since it is identical to
TWNMF if “z” is no-trump, the two conventions are played together. In this approach, it is
still possible to have a fourth-suit auction such as 1♥ - 1♠ - 2♣ - 2♦!.</p>
<p>In another chapter we show an idea of Marc Smith like TWNMF for the case of the 2N rebid.
See <a class="reference internal" href="#nmf2"><span class="std std-ref">TWNMF over 2N</span></a>.</p>
<section id="two-way-new-minor-forcing">
<span id="twnmf"></span><span id="index-1"></span><h2>Two-Way New Minor Forcing<a class="headerlink" href="#two-way-new-minor-forcing" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Two-way New Minor Forcing (TWNMF), also called Two-Way Checkback Stayman, applies after
a 1N rebid by opener after responder bids a major. Responder distinguishes invitational
vs. game-forcing hands with his first rebid.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Some also play TWNMF after auctions that begin 1♣ - 1♦; I do not, to avoid
confusion with the Walsh style. Likewise, some do not play it after 1♥ - 1♠ - 1N.</p>
</div>
<p>TWNMF is off by a passed hand. TWNMF is off after interference.</p>
<p>After 1m 1M 1N, 2M is to play showing 5 cards; playing in even a 2-5 fit is usually better
than playing in 1N.  After 1m - 1♥ - 1N a bid of 2♠ shows a hand 4-4 in the majors with
minimal values.</p>
<section id="checkback-invitational-hands">
<h3>Checkback: Invitational Hands<a class="headerlink" href="#checkback-invitational-hands" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>We bid 2♣!(artificial) with invitational hands containing five of our
major or four of the other major. Opener must rebid 2♦!(forced).
The bid can be explained as “invitational with five of our major or four of the
other major, or a weak hand with diamonds”.</p>
<p>After 1m - 1M - 1N, a weak hand with five cards in M should rebid 2M, to play.</p>
<p>Then, in the case of 1m - 1♠ - 1N - 2♣!(artificial) - 2♦!(forced), responder bids:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Pass - signoff in 2♦.</p></li>
<li><p>2♥- Invitational with 5 spades and 4 hearts.</p></li>
<li><p>2♠- Mildly invitational with 5+ spades.</p></li>
<li><p>2NT - Invitational, with 4-card support for opener’s minor. This allows
opener to sign off in 3 of the minor if he wishes.</p></li>
<li><p>3♣- Invitational with 4 spades and clubs.</p></li>
<li><p>3♦- Invitational with 4 spades and diamonds.</p></li>
<li><p>3♥- Invitational with 5-5 in the majors.</p></li>
<li><p>3♠- Invitational with 6 spades.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If responder’s suit had been hearts, make the corresponding changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Pass - signoff in 2♦.</p></li>
<li><p>2♥- Mildly invitational with 5+ hearts</p></li>
<li><p>2♠- Invitational with 5 hearts and four spades</p></li>
<li><p>2NT- Invitational with four-card support for opener’s minor.</p></li>
<li><p>3♣- Invitational with 4 hearts and clubs</p></li>
<li><p>3♦- Invitational with 4 hearts and diamonds</p></li>
<li><p>3♥- Invitational with 6 hearts</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If responder does not have support for opener’s minor, and no interest in pursuing
a major fit, he raises 1N to 2N and does not use TWNMF. In the sequences above,
the 3m bids show either support for the 1m opener or a decent suit and invitational
values.</p>

<section id="checkback-game-forcing-hands">
<h3>Checkback: Game-Forcing Hands<a class="headerlink" href="#checkback-game-forcing-hands" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The responses for 2♦! are easier; we are not
stopping short of game and use a slow-shows approach to slam. Opener should not
jump. Priorities for opener remain as in NMF:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>With four of the other major, bid 2W</p></li>
<li><p>With 3-card support for M, opener should bid 2M. However, with a flat hand and
the points mostly not in M, consider 2N.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="two-suited-minimal-hands">
<h3>Two-Suited Minimal Hands<a class="headerlink" href="#two-suited-minimal-hands" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you have a minimal hand and bypassed a five-card diamond suit to bid a four-card
major, you can bid the 2♣!(relay) and pass the obligatory 2♦!(forced).</p>
<p>With 5 or more in M, bid 2M to drop dead.  With five spades and four hearts,
bid 2H showing your shape; opener can pass or correct.  It should do better than 1N.</p>
<p>Finally, we have the problem of a weak hand with clubs.  A bid of 3♣ after the 1N
rebid is minimal and to play.  (With a better hand we’d go through the 2♣ or 2♦ bids
first and then bid 3♣).</p>
</section>
<section id="responder-jump-rebids">
<h3>Responder Jump-Rebids<a class="headerlink" href="#responder-jump-rebids" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>After the 1N rebid, a direct bid of 3M shows a slammish hand with a good suit.  We could
go through 2♦! first if we were just game-forcing. A jump to 3♦, such as
1♦ - 1♥ - 1N - 3♦ is slammish in diamonds. But a jump to 3♣ is weak, as noted above.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can make 3♣ a slam try too and show the weak hand in clubs by bidding:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>1N  2N!(relay to 3♣)
3♣!(forced)  Pass
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is possible since a plain balanced invite begins with the 2♣ relay so the direct
2N is an unused bid. The problem is that the 2N bid may be error-prone. So I prefer
having 1m - 1M - 1N - 2N just be natural too and lose the 3♣ slam-try bid.</p>

<section id="xyz">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>XYZ<a class="headerlink" href="#xyz" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-2">XYZ is a convention that applies when the first three bids are on the one level,
and responder has an invitational or better hand. The name comes from writing this as
1X - 1Y - 1Z.</p>
<p>Essentially we extend the ideas of TWNMF to these additional auctions.</p>
<p>Research XYZ with a partner after having plenty of TWNMF experience.</p>

<section id="twnmf-over-2n">
<span id="index-3"></span><span id="nmf2"></span><h2>TWNMF over 2N<a class="headerlink" href="#twnmf-over-2n" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the section on <a class="reference internal" href="Checkback.html#nmf"><span class="std std-ref">New Minor Forcing</span></a>, we saw that in auctions where
the opener rebids 2N to show an 18-19 balanced hand, 1m - 1M - 2N, that a bid of 3w!,
the other minor, is an artificial bid asking if opener has three-card support of M.</p>
<p>A convention responding 3♣ as a relay to 3♦ to signoff weak hands is the Wolff Signoff.
Details are widely available on bridge sites.</p>
<p>A different version with the same signature bid has been suggested by Marc Smith.
You could call it a variant of the Wolff Signoff or TWNMF over 2N:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>3♣! is a mandatory relay to 3♦; see below for examples. This is a
<a class="reference internal" href="Lebensohl.html#lebensohl"><span class="std std-ref">Lebensohl-like</span></a> relay to show various weak hands.</p></li>
<li><p>3♦! is the Stayman-like NMF bid.</p></li>
<li><p>3♥! is a slam try in x. It sets x as trump.</p></li>
<li><p>3♠! is a slam try in M. It sets M as trump.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The 3♣ puppet to 3♦ is used for a number of weak hand types:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>After 1♣-1♠-2N - holding a hand like Jxxxx/xx/QJxxx/x intending to pass
partner’s forced 3♦.</p></li>
<li><p>After 1♥-1♠-2NT - Jxxx/x/KJxxxx/xx same</p></li>
<li><p>After 1x-1♠-2NT - Q109xxx/x/Qxx/xxx intending to sign off in 3♠</p></li>
<li><p>After 1m-1♠-2N - Qxxxx/Kxxxx/xx/x intending to bid 3♥ to offer a choice of
3♥/3♠</p></li>
<li><p>After 1♦-1♠-2N - Jxxx/x/xx/KJxxxx responder bids 3N over 3♦ showing weak with
long clubs - opener can pass or convert to 4♣</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The 3♦ is looking for major fits:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>After 1♣-1♦-2N-3♦ holding something like Kxxx/Qxxx/Axxx/x perhaps - might also have
only one major.</p>
<p>If opener bids 3♥ and responder continues with 3♠, that says I wasn’t
interested in your hearts but I have four spades.
This sequence probably has slam interest as 3NT would also suggest four
spades but no interest beyond game.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After 1m-1♥-2N-3♦ - responder may have any hand with five hearts, just looking
to find a 5-3 fit.</p>
<p>Responder might also have 4-4 in majors. If opener shows 3♥, he can
continue with 3♠/3N as above.</p>
</li>
<li><p>1m-1♠-2N-3♦ - responder could have any hand looking for a 5-3 spade fit,
or 5-4 in majors looking for 4-4 hearts or 5-3 spades.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After the 1x-1M-2N-3♥/♠ slam tries, responder has set trumps and opener should
make control bids.</p>
