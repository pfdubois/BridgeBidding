opponents miserable even though you have a poor hand, by using up the room they
have to maneuver. The opening preempts are those bids above 2♣.</p>

<section id="two-level-preempts">
<h2>Two-Level Preempts<a class="headerlink" href="#two-level-preempts" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Opening bids (or jump overcalls if playing <a class="reference internal" href="JS.html#wjs"><span class="std std-ref">Weak Jump Shifts</span></a>) of
2♦, 2♥, and 2♠ are weak bids, showing a six card suit with 5-10 points, with 10
being rare. (Since 2♣ is the strong opening, 3♣ preempts with six very good clubs are
common.)</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>ACBL regulations are complicated. They depend on the level of the competition.
You should read them. Be aware that some people have much different ranges than 5-10.
They don’t have to alert them in most cases. You can ask or check their cards.</p>
</div>
<p>The meanings of these bids has changed over time. Originally
these two-bids were strong bids.  However, the frequency of hands strong enough
to open at the two level was small, and the difficulties the weak-two bids
cause to the opponents is large, so the strong two bids were all incorporated
into the 2♣ bid, and the 2♦, 2♥, and 2♠ bids became weak.</p>
<p>But how weak? That too has evolved.</p>
<p>In third seat it is generally agreed
that almost anything goes – your partner could not open, and it is very likely their
hand. Interfering with their auction becomes paramount.  In third seat it is often
advisable to open at the two level with a six-card suit if you have even up to 14 HCP.</p>
<p id="index-1">In fourth seat you do not preempt, you pass if you can’t make a one-level opening.
With a six-card suit and a minimal opening hand, you can open at the two-level.</p>
<p>The following styles apply in 1st and 2nd seats.</p>
<p class="rubric">The Traditional Style</p>
<p>In what we might call the traditional style, still taught and played by many but now
giving way to lighter styles, the rules were this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If we are vulnerable, the suit must be a good one, that is, two of
the top three honors or three of the top five, not counting QJT.</p></li>
<li><p>Not vulnerable, the bid promises at least a Queen and a six-card suit.</p></li>
<li><p>Usually one does not preempt in a minor with a four-card major, or even a good three-card
major.</p></li>
<li><p>Some times you preempt at the two-level with a bad seven-card suit.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The most common error is not preempting with too little, but with too much.</p>
<p>The philosophy behind these rules emphasized a combination of competing to the right
contract if it is our hand besides interfering with their auction. Hence the concern
that preempting with a four-card major might be missing a major-suit fit.</p>
<p class="rubric">The Light Style</p>
<p>Expert opinion has swung to these bids being lighter. While a combination of suit
quality and hand strength is relevant when vulnerable, the emphasis is on interference.
The honor requirements are abandoned.  This makes it harder on one’s partner to choose
a response but the odds are that it is their hand rather than ours.</p>
<p>Far from being an inhibition, having a four-card major is viewed as a plus.
If the opponents want to get into the auction they are more likely
to be bidding a minor at the three-level, or getting into a contract in a major
with a poor trump split.</p>
<p>Marc Smith says he routinely opens two of a major in first seat with nothing but a
decent five-card suit.</p>
<p>Do note the appropriate ACBL regulations: you have to state a range on your card, and
it is not entirely free to bid outside it.</p>
<section id="responses">
<span id="index-2"></span><h3>Responses<a class="headerlink" href="#responses" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>A raise from the two level to the three level is purely preemptive and
relies on the idea that a nine card fit is relatively safe at the three
level. It does not require a lot of points, but it does require three
trump. It puts tremendous pressure on the opponents.</p>
<p>Excepting a raise, other bids by responder are forcing. This is referred to as
“Raise Only Non Forcing (RONF)”. The 2N bid is a conventional bid that asks the
opener to bid a suit in which he holds an outside Ace or King, or else to rebid
his suit. Knowing that the opener has an outside entry may permit responder to
go to game. This 2N bid is called “feature-asking”.  There are other schemes
for 2N, chiefly one called <a class="reference internal" href="#id1"><span class="std std-ref">Ogust</span></a>.</p>
<p>Generally a bid other than a raise is going to show a hand of 16 points
or so. You must have a tolerance for opener to simply rebid his suit.  He could quite well
have nothing else to say. Do not bid just to get your partner out of a 6-0 or 6-1 split.</p>
<p>One test used to decide whether to raise a 2M preempt to the four level is the
“Rule of 17”: add the HCP to the number of trumps held, and go to game if the
total is 17 or more. It is best to use your brain, however, and imagine
how the particular cards you hold will play opposite your partner’s. This
is a situation in which it is nice to be confident partner followed the rules
about suit quality.</p>
<p id="index-3">If the opponents overcall our preemptive bid, a double is for penalty. It is not takeout.
Other bids retain their same meanings.</p>

<section id="competing">
<h3>Competing<a class="headerlink" href="#competing" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you preempt, you never bid again unless forced to bid. If your
partner raises you, he isn’t inviting you to go on with a decent preemptive
hand. It is quite a psychological test when you preempt with a hand that is, or
almost is, too good for a preempt. Your partner raises and guilt sinks in. Don’t do it.
He won’t trust you in the future and won’t raise when he should.</p>

<section id="three-level-preempts">
<h2>Three-Level Preempts<a class="headerlink" href="#three-level-preempts" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Three-level opening bids are similar to two-level preempts, except they
show a seven card suit or six good clubs. To compete over such a preempt
requires more than a minimum opening hand.</p>
<p>An advanced idea for pursuing slam after partner preempts is
<a class="reference internal" href="AdvancedSlam.html#id3"><span class="std std-ref">Preempt Keycard</span></a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="four-level-preempts">
<h2>Four-Level Preempts<a class="headerlink" href="#four-level-preempts" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Four-level opening bids are preemptive, showing usually an 8-card suit
or better. The bid is not strong, and partner must be cautious about
going on. Other than that the treatment is similar to the three-level
preempt.</p>

<section id="bidding-in-passout-seat">
<h2>Bidding in Passout Seat<a class="headerlink" href="#bidding-in-passout-seat" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-4">There are no preempts in <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-passout-seat"><span class="xref std std-term">passout seat</span></a>. 2♣ is still strong.
But 2♦, 2♥, and 2♠ show a six card suit, 12-15.</p>
<p>There is no standard meaning for the three-level bids.  An easy idea that I like is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Three level bids are 16-19 with 6(or more) cards.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To bid this way is to say that you would have rebid this
whatever the response to 1x; you are just making both bids at once.</p>
<p>If this situation does not apply, then you may “borrow a King” – that
is, bid as if you had 3 more points than you do. Partner in responding
should bid as if he had three fewer points than he really has. In particular
this means that with more than about 14 points you should double and bid
again.</p>
<p>However, a good guideline is not to open “light” (that is, on a “borrow”) if you do not
have at least one four-card major.  A player who could not open a major may be able to
overcall, and their side will end up with a major contract and a small part-score when you
could have held them to zero by passing the hand out.  Having something in spades in
particular is an important consideration.</p>
<p>Use the “rule of 15”: number of HCP + number of spades must be 15 or
more to open “light”.</p>

<section id="ogust">
<h2>Ogust<a class="headerlink" href="#ogust" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-5"><span id="id1"></span>Ogust (pronouced somewhat like August) is an alternative set of responses to a 2N
inquiry after partner opens a weak two. After 2x - 2N!(hand inquiry):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>3♣ Opener has a bad suit and a bad hand (towards the 5 end rather than the 10)</p></li>
<li><p>3♦ Opener has a good suit but a bad hand.</p></li>
<li><p>3♥ Opener has a bad suit but a good hand.</p></li>
<li><p>3♠ Opener has a good suit and a good hand.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of asking is usually to see if 3N will work.</p>
</section>
<section id="gambling-3n">
<h2>Gambling 3N<a class="headerlink" href="#gambling-3n" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-6"><span id="gambling3n"></span>Since one can open 2♣ and rebid 3N with a balanced 25-27 point hand,
there is no need to open 3N to show this kind of hand. The (non-standard)
Gambling 3N convention uses this bid to show a hand with ALL of these
properties:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A solid minor with at least 7 cards.</p></li>
<li><p>No four-card major</p></li>
<li><p>No Ace or King outside the long minor</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These restrictions are to talk you out of missing a slam and to help
partner precisely visualize his chances for a 3N contract. If partner
does think 3N will make, he passes. That means he has stoppers in the
other suits, because he is under no illusions that you can help. If not,
he bids 4♣ and you correct to diamonds if necessary.</p>
<p>This bid does not come up very often of course, but neither does the one
it replaces. It will lead to rather spectacular failures if you and your
partner are not on the same precise wavelength.</p>
