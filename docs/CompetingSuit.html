<h1><span class="section-number">16. </span>Competing After A Suit Opening<a class="headerlink" href="#competing-after-a-suit-opening" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>This chapter discusses the basic tools of competition, and some special situations.</p>
<section id="overcalls">
<h2>Overcalls<a class="headerlink" href="#overcalls" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>An overcall is a bid after the opponents have opened. This section discusses doing
so when the opponents opened a suit.
The range for an overcall is 8-17 points. With 18 or more, you double first.</p>
<p>Your partner will think it is a <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-takeout"><span class="xref std std-term">takeout</span></a> double at first. This “power double”
is discussed in <a class="reference internal" href="Doubles.html#takeout-double"><span class="std std-ref">Takeout Doubles</span></a>.</p>
<p>If you don’t double
first, partner will assume you have 8-17 and may pass your overcall
despite having enough for game opposite your strong holding.</p>
<p>On the bottom end, a one-level overcall can be much more relaxed than a
two-level overcall. An overcall is above all a request for your partner
to lead your suit, so the first requirement is a suit you want led.</p>
<p>Classify your hand as usual. For a more
dangerous case such as a two-level overcall, especially vulnerable, you need a
good hand and a good suit. For less dangerous cases, you need one or the other.
In both cases, you should want the suit led if your partner becomes the opening
leader.</p>
<p>One case that requires special caution is overcalling a minor at the two level.
Your reward is not high and your risk is high, especially vulnerable.  It is
really best to have a good six-card suit, and 10+ HCP.</p>
<p>You can overcall 1N with 15-18 HCP and a stopper (preferably more) in their suit.
If they have preempted with a 2-level suit bid, overcalling it 2N means about the
same thing but you really would like two stoppers, such as AJx.</p>
<p>With more points and the same kind of hand, you cannot bid 2N, because it is a
conventional bid called <a class="reference internal" href="#unusual"><span class="std std-ref">Unusual Two Notrump</span></a>. You double first.</p>
<p>You can overcall with a very strong four-card suit at the one level, and a maximum
strength. Your partner may not like it but sometimes it is right.</p>
<p>Mike Lawrence’s “Complete Book of Overcalls” has a complete discussion.
He emphasizes understanding the safety of various overcalls. For
example, after an auction that begins (1♣)-P-(2♣), bidding is strongly
encouraged, because RHO does not have diamonds, hearts, or spades, and
has limited values; whereas after (1♥)–P–(2♥), clubs and diamonds
are not safe – either opponent may have them.</p>
<p>When you are in fourth seat, you can overcall, but if passing would end the auction
see <a class="reference internal" href="Balancing.html#balancing"><span class="std std-ref">Balancing</span></a>.  If they have both bid you need a very good suit,
probably six cards, and very good values. This is called a ‘live auction’. For all you
know the opener has a strong hand and was about to bid again. This situation is
dangerous.</p>
<p class="rubric">Responding To Partner’s Overcall</p>
<p>Responding to an overcall:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Recognize in choosing a response that partner’s range is 8-17 HCP because he did not
double. You don’t have to bid if we’re not going anywhere. Resist rescuing.</p></li>
<li><p>A bid of a new suit is forcing by an unpassed hand and denies a fit for the overcall.</p></li>
<li><p>A simple raise is competitive.</p></li>
<li><p>A jump raise is preemptive.</p></li>
<li><p>A <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-cue"><span class="xref std std-term">cue</span></a> bid of opener’s suit is a raise. Generally, we are safe at the level of
the number of trump we have together.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>RHO might bid, most frequently to raise the opener. See
<a class="reference internal" href="SpecialDoubles.html#responsive-double"><span class="std std-ref">Responsive Doubles</span></a>, in which a double shows the unbid suits.</p>
<p>Your partner needs to learn you can be trusted. Avoid these errors:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Overcalling when you should really pass.</p></li>
<li><p>Overcalling with a suit you don’t want led.</p></li>
<li><p>Not leading the overcaller’s suit when you can.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="weak-jump-overcalls">
<h2>Weak Jump Overcalls<a class="headerlink" href="#weak-jump-overcalls" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-0">A jump overcall such as (1♥) 2♠ is essentially like an opening weak two
or three bid. A good suit is needed. As with a preempt, after you make this bid
you should almost never bid again.</p>
<p>Some times you have a hand that could have opened with a weak preempt
but you did not for some reason, such as having an outside four-card
major in first or second seat. If you passed at first you can bid later
once it becomes clear your partner is not being preempted by your bid.</p>
<p>By the way, your partner should respond to this as if you opened a weak two-bid.
In particular, 2N should be whatever it would be for you (feature ask, for example)
had they just opened 2x.</p>

<section id="michaels-cue-bid">
<h2>Michaels Cue Bid<a class="headerlink" href="#michaels-cue-bid" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-1"><span id="michaels"></span>An immediate or balancing cue bid of a suit opener is shows
a distributional hand with 5-5 or better shape, with the suits being
both majors when the opponents bid a minor, and the unbid major and a
minor if the opponents bid a major.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Cue bids are in general not alertable – in fact, 1♣ - (2♣) is only alerted if it
is <em>natural</em>.  However, it is not necessarily Michaels either.  If opponents make
such a bid, be sure to ask what
they mean by it, if only at the end of the auction. This is one case when silence
does not mean standard.</p>
</div>
<p>Advancer can bid 2N! asking for the minor. Except in unusual circumstances,
advancer must choose between partner’s two suits.</p>
<p>The Michaels bid does not show anything more than a prudent overcall but
is unlimited.</p>
<p>Without partnership agreement, (1x) P (1y) 2x is not Michaels but
natural; this is especially possible after 1♣ or 1♦.</p>
<p>Over an opening 2♠, a bid of 3♠ should be <a class="reference internal" href="#id1"><span class="std std-ref">Western Cue</span></a>, asking
partner to bid 3N with a spade stopper. There isn’t enough room for Michaels.</p>
<p>Some partners agree to use Michaels only with minimal or maximum hands –
see <a class="reference internal" href="#minimax"><span class="std std-ref">Minimax</span></a>.</p>
<p>A question arises when the Michaels bid shows a major and an unknown suit,
and the responder makes a bid, but advancer has no support for the major.
E.g., (1♥) 2♥ (3♦) ?. Typically responder’s 3♦ bid shows a weak hand with diamonds,
if opponents are playing unusual vs. unusual, but many intermediate pairs
will lack agreements. With values but lacking spade support here, and
ideally holding at least two diamonds, advancer should double, asking for the second suit
or a penalty pass.</p>
<p>Without values, of course, you are off the hook and can pass.</p>
<p>An advanced agreement is that the 2N reply asking for the second suit shows a good hand,
while 3♣ asks for the second suit. A bid like 3♣ is a “pass or correct” bid; the
Michaels bidder will pass if his second suit is clubs.</p>
</section>
<section id="unusual-2nt">
<h2>Unusual 2NT<a class="headerlink" href="#unusual-2nt" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-2"><span id="unusual"></span>Unusual 2NT is a direct or balancing 2N bid after a 1-level
opening. It shows a hand of unstated strength that is at least 5-5 in
the lowest two unbid suits. Advancer should choose the best of these two
suits, except in remarkable circumstances.</p>
<p>Unusual 2NT is not alertable. Some partners agree to use Unusual 2NT only with weak or
strong hands, see <a class="reference internal" href="#minimax"><span class="std std-ref">Minimax</span></a>.</p>
<p>It is also possible to recognize other “impossible” no-trump bids as unusual.
For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>(1♣) P (1♠) 2N</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>would show 5-5 in the red suits. Logically, nobody has a big enough hand to
bid no-trump at the two level here. 2N specifically shows the 5-5 shape,
while a double would be takeout but presumably not that good a shape.</p>
<p>Another possible agreement: if they preempt four of something, 4N is unusual
notrump, asking advancer to pick his best of the two lowest unbid suits.
Double’s meaning depends on your agreed takeout double limit. Some play 4N as
a two-suited takeout.</p>
<p class="rubric">Minimax Style</p>
<p id="index-3"><span id="minimax"></span>Minimax is an optional style of bidding Michaels and Unusual 2N.
If you are playing minimax, it means you use these bids only with a maximum or
a minimum; with a medium hand you bid the higher-ranked suit, hoping to show
the other later.</p>
<p>When playing minimax, advancer will assume the weaker hand until his
partner bids again to show the good hand.</p>
<p>The minimum would be an adequate overcall but less than an opener, while
a maximum would be more than 15 points.</p>
<p>Minimax allows more certainty in responses to two-suited bids, at the price of
not being able to make those bids as often.</p>

<section id="western-cue">
<h2>Western Cue<a class="headerlink" href="#western-cue" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-4"><span id="id1"></span>When we are in a contested auction a (usually) three-level cue-bid of the opponent’s suit
denies a stopper in their suit(s) and asks partner to bid
3N if they have a stopper. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">1♦ (1♥) 1♠ - 2♣ - 3♥!(asking for heart stopper)</div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Responder is asking opener to bid 3N if he has a stopper in hearts. Quite often
the Western Cue bidder has some help in their, such as a half-stopper, but does
not feel secure bidding 3N on their own.</p>
