<p>This is a book on Two Over One Game Force and SAYC, written for an advanced beginner up to an advanced player. 
It is not intended for experts. The book can be used as a reference or
as a textbook, but as a textbook it does not contain a lot of examples and would
best be used in conjuction with online lessons from a teacher and 
reading bridge books by professionals.
See the chapter on Resources for more materials on any given topic.</p>

<p>In the first part of the book, I provide a system with less choice than most books offer. For one thing, it is Two Over One from the git-go.
It was a source of frustration to me as a beginner to be told that I could do this or that, when I had no idea of the consequences of my choices. So, I'm 
going to tell you one way, with some guidelines as to how to add in all the 
ideas you need as you improve.</p>
    
<p>
The Advanced chapters are in contrast full of all 
sorts of optional or different ways of doing things. I imagine a player learning 
the base system and getting very solid at it, gradually choosing other 
methods in response to their own experience and partners' opinions.

    The book is available as web pages, as a single-file web page, as a PDF file, and in EPUB format for e-book readers.  All of these can be downloaded by clicking the links below.
    </p>
    <p>The "single file" directory actually has some style information alongside, but if you opened the
    index.html file somewhere else, table of contents is at the bottom instead of in a side panel.</p>

<p>Each of these links opens in a new tab or window.</p>
