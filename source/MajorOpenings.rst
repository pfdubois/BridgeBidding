Responding To Major Openings
============================

.. _major_opener:

.. index::
   pair: opening; major


Please review 
:ref:`Classifying Your Hand <classification>` to classify your hand as weak, competitive,
invitational, game-going, or slam interest. 

If you have support for partner's major, be sure to revalue your hand and do a
:term:`losing trick count`. Sometimes HCP aren't the whole story.  An 11 
HCP hand, especially one with four trump, or a hand with an LTC of 7, may be
appropriate for treating as game-going. 

We focus on finding eight or more card major fits.  There is also an effort to
distinguish nine-card fits from eight-card fits, as nine-card fits are much
easier to play.

Two Over One Game Force
-----------------------

.. index:: 1N Forcing

.. index:: Two Over One 

.. index:: 2/1

If you are *not a passed hand*, and there is *no interference*, and
your partner opened a *suit other than clubs*, then...

OK, wait, before I tell you, that was the hard part. When you start
playing 2/1 you are going to be getting mixed up because you apply these
rules in the wrong context.  When you see what looks like a 2/1 bid you have to stop
and ask "What has happened so far?".  By the way, the principles we are discussing also
apply to the 1♦ - 2♣ auction.

Ready? Here we go again.

If you are *not a passed hand*, and there is *no interference*, and
your partner opened a *suit other than clubs*, then a non-jump two-level response in a 
new suit is forcing to game or four of a minor. There are six such sequences:
   
* 1♦ - 2♣
* 1♥ - 2♣ or 2♦
* 1♠ - 2♣, 2♦, or 2♥

All of these sequences show four card or longer suits (rarely, three) with the exception 
of 1♠ – 2♥, which promises five hearts. Jump bids like 1♦ – 2♠ are not
2/1 bids. 

If responder is a passed hand, or if there is competition, everything is standard, as 
we discuss next in :ref:`Standard Responses <standard>`.
Over a 1♣ opening, everything (including 1N) is standard.

The auction 1♦ - 2♣ is special and was treated separately in the chapter on 
:ref:`Responding To Minor Openings <MinorOpenings>`.

Along with 2/1 we must play :ref:`1N Forcing <OneNoForcing>`. Responding 1N now
has a range of six to twelve points, rather than six to 10.  The reason is that
while we used to make bids like 1M - 2♣ with 10 to 12 points, we cannot do that any more.
So, if we didn't widen the range of 1N to include such hands, we'd have no bid.


.. _standard:

   triple:major responses;as a passed hand;in competition

Standard Responses
------------------

Here are the replies to a one of a major opening when 2/1 and 1N forcing are
not in effect. Either we are a passed hand or our RHO has interfered. When we
are a passed hand, we must be cautious in case partner opened light. People
playing the older "Standard American" (SAYC) system just use these rules all
the time, and they are pretty much the rules we saw for minor openings.

We will assume now that you're a passed hand. The interference case is 
covered later.

Weak Hands
~~~~~~~~~~

If you have less than 6 HCP you can pass. If you have four trump with 5 points
or an Ace, it is probably worth giving partner a simple raise. Do not try to
rescue partner if you have a stiff or void in his suit.  If you do, he may just
bid it again.  Worst case, you're only at the one level and your partner has
five trump.

If you happen to have five or more of your partner's major, bid 4M. This is,
contrary to appearances, a weak bid.  We may have only half the deck but in our
suit we have at least ten of them.  If we don't make, at least we kept them out
of finding their fit. Such a bid is called a :term:`preemptive` raise. 

.. warning:
   Do not bid 4M with a better hand. We go slow because stopping partner at game 
   might cause us to miss a slam. The most common error I see in intermediates is
   bidding 4M immediately with an opening hand.
   
If playing :ref:`Weak Jump Shifts <wjs>` one might be made here; we assume that
in this book.

Competitive Hands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have six to a bad ten HCP, you must bid.  Even if you have a void in
partner's suit, you must bid. Your partner could have an unbalanced hand with
21 points. 

.. warning:
   Repeat after me: you must respond with 6 or more HCP.  
   
There are three possible bids with a competitive hand: 2M, 1♠, and 1N:

* With three or more of your partner's suit M, you make a simple 
  raise to 2M. Support with support! Otherwise,
* Over 1♥, bid 1♠ if you have four spades.
* Bid 1N. This says you do not any other bid.  With a competitive hand, you can't bid 
  a new suit at the two-level. That requires a good 10 HCP.

If you are a passed hand none of these bids is forcing. We will discuss interference
later.

Important: 1M - 1N does not say you have a balanced hand. If we made such a requirement,
and your partner opens 1♥, suppose we have this hand:

    | ♠K92 ♥2 ♦Q8763 ♣Q952
    
We would be stuck.  Let's see why:

* We absolutely cannot pass with those 7 HCP.
* We can't raise hearts.
* We don't have four spades.
* We don't have enough for a 2-level reply, which rules out 2♦ or 2♣.
* The only bid left is 1N. 

Our hand is not balanced, so if 1N had to be balanced, we would have no bid.

.. warning::
   Don't confuse a notrump RESPONSE such as 1♥ - 1N,  with a notrump REBID such as
   1♦ - 1♥ - 1N.  When an opener bids notrump on his second bid it *does* promise 
   a balanced hand. 

A competitive hand gets one bid, unless opener forces another out of you or gives you
a choice of parking places. So if your partner bids his suit again, you pass. 

"Really?", I hear you ask. "He's rebid 2♥ and I don't have any hearts and you want me 
to pass?". Yes. No rescuing allowed. As we will see, partner will have six hearts,
so if you bid three of something expect him to not have any of those and bid 3♥. You 
may have just bid past the only contract we could make.

Invitational Hands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your hand is invitational (first revaluing it if you have a fit):

With three or more of your partner's major, we raise. This invitational raise
is  called a :term:`limit raise` because the bid limits your strength to this
narrow range. 

We bid 2♣!(limit raise, 3 or more cards) to make a limit raise. This is a conventional
bid called :ref:`Reverse Drury <Reverse_Drury>`, discussed next.

Drury is off with any kind of interference and 2♣ goes back to its natural meaning, 
five+ clubs with invitational values.

* Bid 2♣!(limit raise), forcing.
* Over 1♥, bid 1♠ with four+ spades;
* Bid 2♥ over 1♠ with five+ hearts;
* Bid 2♦ over 1M with five+ diamonds;
* Bid 2N with a balanced hand.
* Bid 3♣ with an invitational hand and usually six clubs.
* If your invitational hand revalued to game, use Drury. Give partner a chance to say 
  he opened light. You can bid game on your next bid if he doesn't reply 2M.

Again, none of these bids is forcing by a passed hand, except of course the artificial
2♣ bid. Yes, our 2/1 bids are invitational because we are a passed hand (or if there 
was interference) so the game-forcing bids are not in effect.
   
Reverse Drury
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _Reverse_Drury:

.. index::
   pair: convention; Reverse Drury
   pair: convention; Drury
   pair: third or fourth seat; major opening

Reverse Drury is one of the 
:ref:`expected conventions <expected_conventions>` for a 2/1 player. Reverse Drury 
requires partnership agreement.

When 1M is opened in third or fourth seat, it may be light. Reverse
Drury lets responder show a limit raise 
without getting too high by bidding 2♣! as a limit raise rather than 3M.
Reverse Drury does not apply over interference.  

Note that the natural 2♣ bid is no longer available, so a responder might have
to bid 3♣ over 1M to show 10 points with a five-card club suit and no support for
the major. (Combined with 1♦ - 3♣ meaning the same thing, 3♣ as a response is 
always invitational and not forcing).

Opener now reveals his strength:

* 2M Opener's hand was substandard. Responder passes. We're not at 3M, where we 
  would have been without this convention.
* 2♦! (Opener had an honest opener).
* 3M! (Opener has 14 points).

In the original convention, 2♦, 2M, and 3M are the only possible
responses. However, we extend the convention somewhat to allow the
opener to in effect make a game try. When opener bids a suit other than
2M, opener is making a :ref:`help-suit game try <hsgt>`, and has a full opener. 
Responder may now bid game or stop at 3M. 

Note: the "Reverse" in "Reverse Drury" is historical; when the convention was first 
suggested, the 2♦ response and the 2M response were swapped. 

Add Reverse Drury to your partnership as soon as you feel you both can recognize it. 
You'll have to regret the times someone misses it. Also played by many is the two-way
version, in which 2♣! is a three-card limit raise and 2♦! is a four or more card 
limit raise. 

Responding As An Unpassed Hand
------------------------------

.. index::
   pair: opening; major

.. index:: 1N Forcing

.. index:: 2/1

.. index:: Two Over One

.. _twooverone:

This system, Two Over One Game Force, slows the auction down on game-going
hands. This makes for better slam bidding because neither partner needs to jump
just to keep the auction alive. In fact, once the game force is established,
the slower you go, the more powerful a hand you are showing. 
The saying is, "Slow Shows".

The changes are all for invitational or better hands with no competition. Weak and 
competitive hands are treated as before. 

#. The range of the 1N response becomes 6-12 instead of 6-10. 
   Opener will :term:`announce` "forcing" and he must make another bid.
   See :ref:`1N Forcing <OneNoForcing>` for continuations.
   Honestly, the 1N forcing part is the hard part. The 2/1 auctions are easy.

#. 2N is a conventional bid showing a four-card game-forcing raise. 
   See :ref:`Jacoby 2NT <Jacoby2NT>` for continuations.
   
#. A bid of 2♥ over 1♠ promises five hearts and is game-forcing. It therefore 
   requires an opening hand rather than just 10 points.

#. A bid of 2m over 1M promises three in the minor and is game-forcing. It therefore 
   requires an opening hand rather than just 10 points.

#. A bid of 2♣ over 1♦, although not the subject of this chapter, also changes 
   to be game forcing. It therefore requires an opening hand rather than just 10 points.
    
What follows is further discussion of these eight changes, six 2/1 bids, the forcing
1N bid (:ref:`in the next chapter <OneNoForcing>`), and the 2N strong raise.

Another change is that after a 2/1 bid, there are no reverses::

   1♥ - 2♣
   2♠ 
   
does not show extras, just that we have at least four spades. So, we no longer 
necessarily bid 1♠ over 1♥. With a game-forcing hand
we make a 2/1 bid with our longest suit. We can show the spades later, no longer worried 
about reversing.

After a 2N! game-forcing raise or 2/1 bids, we must make sure we bid game. Neither party 
can pass short of it. "Bidding game" is a slight misnomer; you can stop in
four of a minor even though that is not a game. However, this phrase is common
bridge terminology so we will use it.

Sometimes you bid suits as short as 3 cards.
Suppose your partner opens 1♠, and your shape is 3=4=2=4 with 13 HCP. 
You have a dilemma:

* 2♠ shows 6-10 HCP, so you're too strong for that.
* 3♠ shows 10-12 HCP, and again you're too strong.
* 4♠ shows 5 trump and a weak hand -- again, not appropriate.
* 2♥ is possible only if you have five hearts. You don't.
* 1N is forcing, but while you can use it with a three-card raise in an emergency,
  followed by a 4M bid, it really implied at most 12 points.  We hate to lie.
* 2N! is 
  :ref:`Jacoby 2NT <Jacoby2NT>` which is game-forcing and promises 4 trump. 
* 3N gets to the wrong game. Partner will never guess you have support.
  3N shows 13-15 HCP and usually exactly two cards in M.

Therefore, you will bid 2♣; this is forcing because it is a new suit by an unpassed 
hand. You'll tell partner about the support on your next bid by bidding spades. 

Had your shape been 3=4=3=3 you'd be bidding a three-card suit. That's ok; it is forcing. 
You're sure to get another bid.


Summary of Responses To 1M

Notes:

* BPH = By Passed Hand
* Invitational raises are also called limit raises.
* (d) BPH limit raise becomes 2♣ :ref:`Reverse Drury <Reverse_Drury>` when learned.
* Weak hands below six HCP just pass, or bid 4M if they have four trump. 
* 1N(f) is forcing by an unpassed hand. Announced.
* Bidding a new suit at the two level must be 5+ hearts or 3+ in a minor.
* Jacoby 2NT shows four trump; with just three, force to game first with a 2/1 bid.

When Do You Bypass A Major?
---------------------------

After a 1♥ opener, holding four spades, do you always bid 1♠? No. With
game-forcing values and a five-card minor as well as four spades, bid
the five-card minor at the two level to force to game. To make this work, we agree that a 
2♠ rebid by the opener is not a reverse. Thus, if we have a 4-4 spade fit, we will find 
it. 

If you do bid 1♠ over 1♥ holding five spades, opener may rebid 1N or 2N.
If they do, you can use :ref:`New Minor Forcing <nmf>` with invitational or better
values to find a 5-3 fit. 

Many people have trouble recognizing NMF in auctions with a 2N rebid::

   1♦ 1♠
   2N 3♣!(New Minor Forcing)

When you do decide to respond 1♠ with game-forcing values, it is ok;
just be sure that your subsequent bids cannot be passed. :ref:`NMF <nmf>`
and :ref:`Fourth-Suit Forcing <FSF>` are important tools here.

Jacoby 2NT
~~~~~~~~~~

.. _Jacoby2NT:

.. index::
   pair: convention; Jacoby 2NT
   pair: 2NT; Jacoby, Jordan

In response to a major opening, and in the absence of any interference,
a bid of 2N is called Jacoby 2NT. It is alerted as a game-forcing raise with 
four or more trump. 

2N can still be used as a limit raise or better if opponents interfere with a double.
See :ref:`Jordan 2NT <Jordan2NT>`.

:: rubric::
   Responding to Jacoby 2NT

Opener responds to J2NT by revaluing his hand in light of the
fit. We call this new value "declarer points". Then with a balanced hand,

-  1M - 2N! - 4M Less than 15 declarer points
-  1M - 2N! - 3N 15-17 declarer points, semi-balanced
-  1M - 2N! - 3M 18+ declarer points.

Note the theme -- the slower you go, the more you have. This is often termed,
:term:`slow shows`. With a big hand, go as slow as you can but no slower; you must
never make a bid your partner can pass short of game.

With an unbalanced hand,

-  1M - 2N! - 3♣/♦/♥/♠ stiff or void in the bid suit.
-  1M - 2N! - 4a, a very good second 5-card suit, and no more than 13
   HCP.

Note the “slow shows” nature of the balanced bids. If you have a choice
between showing a second five card suit or a stiff, show
the second suit if it is a good suit and you are at a minimum. However,
if you have a void, show the void.

After the opener replies to J2N, a non-jump bid in a side suit is a control bid, 
which are discussed in more detail in the chapter on 
:ref:`slam bidding <control_bidding>`.

In :ref:`The Hand <TheHand>` we met these two hands and evaluated them to around
16 and 15 points each:

::

   West           East
   ♠K862          ♠AQ
   ♥AKJ95         ♥T632
   ♦T5            ♦AKQ6
   ♣KJ            ♣964 

If West had been the Dealer, West would open either 1♥ or 1N, as we discussed.
Suppose West opens 1♥. East has an opening hand and four hearts so would respond
with Jacoby 2NT. West has no shortness to show nor a good five-card suit, but with
extra values bids 3N::

   1♥ 2N!(four-card gf raise)
   3N(15-17 HCP, semi-balanced)
   
On this hand East would then probably bid 4♦ to show the diamond control and no
club control. We are at least near slam. But some would just bid 4♥, I'm sure, 
thinking their hand is not that great. 


.. _interference_major:

Interference Over Major Openings
--------------------------------

.. index::
   pair: interference; major opening
   pair: interference; negative double

Over an overcall, new suit bids basically show what they would have without the
overcall. The 2/1 bids are no longer game forcing, but back to the standard 10+ points 
and a five-card suit and they won't be hiding 3-card support.  You may not be able to 
make the bid you wanted to make
because it would now be at the two level and you don't have 10 points, or it would
require five cards in the suit when you only have four.

We'll learn details about :ref:`negative doubles <negative_double>` and other
competitive bids later to deal with those situations. For this chapter, we'll
talk about how to support partner after the interference.

For example, the auction starts 1♥ - (2♣).  We had a hand that would have bid
1♠ but we only have four spades so we can't bid 2♠. We double, a "negative
double", to tell partner of our distress.

To take another example, 1♦ - (1♠). Before we were so rudely interrupted we
were going to bid 1♥ with our five hearts and 8 HCP. But now, 2♥ would show 10+
points, so we can't bid that. The negative double says, partner, I have four
hearts, at least, but either I'm not strong enough or I don't have five hearts.
Don't worry, I have a plan if you bid clubs.

.. index::
   pair: cue bid; limit raise

.. index:: negative double

To support after an overcall,

- Raise to 2 with 5-9 and 3+ cards.
- Most hands with Axxx are also worth a raise to 2, especially in
  spades.
- Cue-bid the overcalled suit to make a limit raise or better.
- A jump cue bid is a power raise with four trump, equivalent to J2NT.
  Example: 1♥ - (1♠) - 3♠!(four hearts, game forcing).
- A jump raise is preemptive in nature.
- A jump to 4 of the major shows a weak hand and 5+ trump.
- 2N becomes an invitational bid with a balanced hand, but it shows a stopper in 
  their suit.  
- 3N bids game, again with stoppers, but no support.

Thus, 1♠ – 3♠ would have meant a limit raise, but 1♠ (2♣) 3♠ shows a
weak hand with at least four trump. Having nine trump between the
hands should be relatively safe at the three level. 

In this case, 1♠ (2♣) 3♣ is the limit raise. This lets opener sign
off at 3♠ if he does not want to accept the invitation.

Examples:

-  1♥ (1♠) 2♠! limit raise+ in hearts
-  1♥ (2♦) 2♥ 5-9, at least three hearts
-  1♥ (2♦) 3♥ weak hand, 4+ hearts
-  1♥ (1♠) 3♥ weak hand, 4+ hearts
-  1♥ (1♠) 4♥ weak hand, 5+ hearts
-  1♥ ( X) 2N! Limit raise or better, 3+ hearts. Forcing for one round.
-  1♥ (1♠) 2N Invitational, balanced hand. This bid can be passed.
-  1♥ (2♦) 4♦ is an opening hand with four hearts, game forcing.
-  1♥ (2♠) presents a quandary because the 3♠ cue-bid would force opener to game.
   If you have a suitable hand you might be able to make a negative double and come back 
   to 3♥ to compete. A plain 3♥ is invitational. Lacking the strength to bid 3♥, all you 
   can do is pass.

To support after a double, simple raises remain the same, but stronger raises use 
Jordan 2NT, discussed next.
   
.. index::
   triple:2N;Jordan;Truscott

.. _Jordan2NT:
   
Jordan 2NT
----------

If the opener's LHO makes a takeout double of a major, 2N! shows a limit raise or better
with four trump.

   | 1M - (X) - 2N!(four-card limit raise or better)

This bid is called Jordon 2NT (who popularized it in America) or Truscott  2NT
(who invented it in 1954) or Dormer 2NT (who popularized it in Europe).

This shows four trump as in Jacoby 2NT; with 3 card support, one makes a 
:ref:`"going for blood" redouble <blood>`.  

However, my recommended partnership agreement for
intermediates is to make a Jordan 2N bid with 3-card support also -- the
redouble sequences are rather difficult. Jordan over the takeout double gets the
support message in early so partner can revalue their hand, and prevents a
low-level bid from the opponents.

One of the competitive principles we use is that jumps in competition are weak. A
notable exception is replying to your partner's takeout double.  Until we get
to all that, just note that a bid of 3M here is a preemptive four-card raise.

Discussion
----------

The Most Frequent Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most frequent responder error after a major opening is to raise to game because 
you have an opening hand with support. That's understandable; you do need to reach 
game for sure. But the problem is you may be underestimating the opener's hand and 
missing a slam.

Say partner has opened 1♥ in first seat, and you have ♠AJ5 ♥KQ8 ♦72 ♣AT983. 

You have a dilemma. Your hand revalues to about 16 points -- one for the doubleton
and one for the extra club. You cannot bid:

* 1♠ -- you'd be lying, because you do not have four spades
* 1N --  forcing, but conceals your extra values.
* 2♥ or 3♥ -- too small, not forcing so partner might pass
* 4♥ -- too big, this is a shutout showing a weak hand and five trumps.

The just-right Goldilocks response is 2♣; your next bid will be 4♥. Note that
you could bid 1N(forcing) with a minimal hand with three hearts, bidding 4♥
next. However, with the extras in this hand, 2♣ is right.

Note what happens if the bidding goes 1♥ - 4♥. Opener holding ♠K9 ♥AJT742 ♦AK9
♣K2 is going to think that the partnership has at most 25 points and is not
going to explore for a slam that actually has excellent chances.

With some hands, such as ♠AJ5 ♥KQ83 ♦972 ♣AT9, you might even be bidding a
three-card suit. That's ok; your bid is forcing and you'll
be able to clarify on your next bid. This is also an object lesson on why a new
suit by an unpassed hand is forcing; sometimes responder must make something up
to keep the bidding going. Don't be tempted to pass 2♣ because you have bid
with a minimal opener and have clubs. It is, however, important not to bid 2♥
over 1♠ unless you have five of them.

Note that if you are a passed hand, your hand might have just become game
forcing due to the fit. Still, you don't just bid 4♥ right away. You bid
2♣!(reverse Drury), showing a limit raise. If partner then bids 2♥, you can
then raise to 4♥, telling your story beautifully -- I had a near-opening hand,
but now that you bid hearts, I have enough for game with my distribution.

What's My Limit Raise?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index:: 
   pair: raise; major

To avoid confusion in the heat of battle, realize this: in any situation there is one 
and only one bid that shows a limit raise (or better). First, stop and 
revalue your hand in light of the fit, and then choose your raise. This chart 
shows what to do to make a limit raise:

.. table:: Major Suit Limit Raises

   +-------------------+--------------------+----------------------+
   |                   | Unpassed Hand      | Passed Hand          |
   +===================+====================+======================+
   | No competition    | 3M                 | 2♣!(reverse Drury)   |
   +-------------------+--------------------+----------------------+
   | They doubled      | 2N!(Jordan)        | 2N!(Jordan)          |
   +-------------------+--------------------+----------------------+
   | They overcalled   | cue bid            | cue bid              |
   +-------------------+--------------------+----------------------+


The bids that show at least a limit raise are artificial (rows two and three); 
this ensures that you will get to bid again, in case you have a game-forcing hand.
(Even if a passed hand, your hand may have gotten better).

So, ask yourself, “What's my limit raise?”. If you get that right, everything 
else will be easy.

There is a problem when they make a weak overcall, in that your cue bid might
force to game but you do not have the requisite values. One difficult case is
1♥ (2♠); at this point a cue bid of 3♠ might as well be 4♥. Experts here may
have an agreement that 2N is a four-card limit raise, but you'd have to have a
very firm agreement with a partner to play that.

Absent any agreement 3♥ here is just a good competitive hand -- you're saying you
think we can make that even if partner is an opener. With a minimal competitive 
hand you just pass or consider a negative double.

A cue bid that is forcing to game is still appropriate some times:

- 1♥ (2♠) 4♥ is a weak hand with five hearts
- 1♥ (2♠) 3♠ is a game force showing an opening hand or better.
