   ACBL
      The American Contract Bridge League (acbl.org) issues the rules that
      govern most tournament play in North America. 

   convention
      A bid which changes the standard meaning of that bid to serve
      another purpose, together with its followups.
      
   HCP
      High-card points. See Hand Evaluation.
      
   points
      The total value of both :term:`HCP` and distributional factors.

   relay
      A bid which requires partner to bid a certain suit, but does 
      not imply possession of that suit by the bidder.  Compare to 
      :term:`transfer`.

   pass or correct
      A bid intended to either be passed or corrected to another suit. See 
      Minor Relay for an example.

   transfer
      A bid which requests partner to bid a certain suit which is held by
      the bidder; the intent is usually to cause partner to be the declarer
      if that suit is trump. Usually the suit bid is one denomination belows
      than the suit requested, known as the *target suit*. 

      If partner bids the target suit as requested it is called 
      *accepting* the transfer. If he bids it but one level higher than
      necessary it is called a *super-accept*; and if he bids something else
      it is called *breaking* the transfer.

      Compare to :term:`relay`.

   Rule of 17
      A guideline used to help determine whether or not to raise a preemptive
      major bid by partner to game. The rule says to add your :term:`HCP` and
      number of trumps, and bid game if the total is 17 or more.

   Rule of 20
      A hand is said to satisfy the Rule of 20 if its number of high card 
      points plus the sum of the lengths of its two longest suits adds up
      to 20 or more. 
      
   fit
      A fit in a given suit is when we find our side has eight or more cards in it.
      See also :term:`Moysian Fit`.
      
   Moysian Fit
      Having exactly seven cards in a suit between the partner's hands. This 
      is not treated as "having a fit".

   Law of Total Tricks
      A guideline used to help determine how high to bid in a competitive
      auction. With a trump fit of 8 cards or more, and the :term:`HCP` 
      fairly evenly divided, the  number of tricks the partnership can expect 
      to win is approximately the total number of trump held by the partners.
      
   game try
      A game try is a bid suggesting that we are close to game if partner has a 
      suitable hand, and asks partner to decide or to show interest but not enough
      to bid game by themselves.  There are several systems for doing this, the most
      popular being :term:`help-suit` game tries.
      
   help-suit
      A help-suit game try is a :term:`game try` 
      asking partner to bid game if they have help in the suit bid or 
      a near-maximal holding for their bid.  Help is defined as an Ace, King, singleton,
      void, or five cards in the suit.

      1N - 2♠ minor relay convention, opener bids 3♣. If responder then bids 3 of a major
      it is a flag bid, 3♥ showing a slam try in clubs and 3♠ a slam try in diamonds.

      From a book by Ron Klinger. 
      
   call
      A call is a person's choice of contribution to the auction when it is their turn.
      A call could be Pass. A :term:`bid` is a call that is not a Pass.
      
   bid
      A bid is a :term:`call` other than a Pass, including double or redouble.
      
   Rule of 
      Add your HCP and the lengths of your longest two suits. If that number is 20 or 
      more your hand is said to satisfy the "Rule of 20". The Rule of 17 and

      a diamond suit when replying to a 1♣ opener in favor of showing a four-card major.    
      
   level
      The number of tricks in excess of six that a bid contracts for. For a bid of 3♥ 
      the level is 3 and the :term:`strain` is hearts.

   checkback
      A convention that asks if opener has three-card support for our major or four
      cards in the other major. See :ref:`Fourth Suit Forcing <FSF>`,
      :ref:`New Minor Forcing <NMF>`, and 
      :ref:`Two Way New Minor Forcing <TWNMF>`.  
      
    drop dead
       A bid that partner must pass.

      dummy's first bid suit. See :ref:`Lightner Double <LightnerDouble>`.
      
   rank
      A card's rank is the symbol on it, such as 2, 3, .., King. The rank of a suit
      is its position in the sequence (from lowest to highest) ♣, ♦, ♥, ♠.
