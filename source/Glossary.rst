   ACBL
      The American Contract Bridge League (acbl.org) issues the rules that
      govern most tournament play in North America. 

   Captain
      Refers to the partner who knows the other's strength and shape within 
      sufficient limits that he must decide the correct path to the final
      contract, after possibly gathering more information.  Later, switches of 
      leadership may occur, but generally the Captain is in charge.

   Drury
      A convention played after a major opening in third or fourth seat when 
      the responder is a passed hand, to show a :term:`limit raise` or better.
      Reverse Drury and Two-Way Reverse Drury are two variants; the original version
      is almost never played today.

   Garbage Stayman
      An optional convention used with Stayman to show weak hands 5-4 or 5-5 in the 
      majors. Responder bids 2♥! after a 2♦ response to Stayman, asking opener to
      pass or correct to spades.
      
   Gerber
      A bid of 4 clubs that asks responder how many Aces he holds.

   HCP
      High-card points. See Hand Evaluation.
      
   LHO 
      Left hand opponent; the player to the left of the player 

   Law of Total Tricks
      A guideline used to help determine how high to bid in a competitive
      auction. With a trump fit of 8 cards or more, and the :term:`HCP` 
      fairly evenly divided, the  number of tricks the partnership can expect 
      to win is approximately the total number of trump held by the partners.
      
   Lebensohl
      An advanced convention for disambiguating strengths of responder's hand
      especially after an overcall of a 1N opener.

   Lightner
      A kind of double of a final contract that asks for an unusual lead, often 
      dummy's first bid suit. See :ref:`Lightner Double <LightnerDouble>`.
      
   Losing Trick Count
      A way to estimate of how many tricks we'll take, once we've agreed on a fit.
      From a book by Ron Klinger. 
      
   Minorwood
      An ace-asking bid of four of the minor, played with inverted minors.

   Moysian Fit
      Having exactly seven cards in a suit between the partner's hands. This 
      is not treated as "having a fit".

   RHO
      Right hand opponent; the player to the right of the player 

   Rubensohl
      A :term:`transfer` version of :term:`Lebensohl`. Be afraid. Be very afraid.

   Rule of 
      Add your HCP and the lengths of your longest two suits. If that number is 20 or 
      more your hand is said to satisfy the "Rule of 20". The Rule of 17 and 
      The Rule of 19 are also used in ACBL convention charts. You may see Rule of 21
      or Rule of 22 in books; those are the Rule of 20 with additional requirements.
      
   Rule of 17
      A guideline used to help determine whether or not to raise a preemptive
      major bid by partner to game. The rule says to add your :term:`HCP` and
      number of trumps, and bid game if the total is 17 or more.

   Rule of 20
      A hand is said to satisfy the Rule of 20 if its number of high card 
      points plus the sum of the lengths of its two longest suits adds up
      to 20 or more. 
      
   SOS redouble
      A redouble in the passout seat after an opening bid has been doubled 
      for takeout or for balancing. 

   Sandwich 1N
      After opponents have bid 1x - 1y, a 1N conventional bid to show the other two suits 
      with a sub-opening hand.
      
   Smolen
      An artificial convention to show the five-card suit in a five-four hand.  

   Stayman
      The Stayman Convention is classically a bid of the lowest number of clubs after
      a notrump opening; it inquires about the opener's major suit holdings.
      The term is also used to refer other bids with the same purpose.

   UDA
     Short for "upside down attitude, right-side up count". A low card is
     encouraging or from an even number.

   UDCA
      Short for "upside-down count and upside-down attitude" card signals.
      A low card is encouraging or from an odd number.

   W
      W is our notation for the "other" major in an auction where a 
      major M has been bid.

   Walsh
      The style, taught in this book, where a less-than-game-forcing hand will bypass
      a diamond suit when replying to a 1♣ opener in favor of showing a four-card major.

      or 4-3-3-3. Usually the term includes the :term:`semi-balanced` hands also.
      Otherwise put, a hand with no singleton or void and at most two doubletons.

   balancing
      To make a bid in :term:`passout seat` when your partner has passed.
      For example, (1♥) - P - (\P) - 1♠ and (1♥) - P- (2♥) - P; (\P) 2♠

   flat
      A flat hand is one with a shape of 4333. The most frequent shapes are 5332,

      you hope.
