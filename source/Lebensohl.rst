Lebensohl
=========

The Lebensohl idea is perhaps the key idea of advanced bidding. This idea is
applicable in a wide variety of competitive situations, but
we begin by learning it as a way of dealing with interference over a 1N
opener. It can also be used after partner doubles a 2-level preempt or
when opponents interfere over a 2♣ opener, or after an opener's reverse, and in other 
competitive situations.  We cover the other situations later.

What these seemingly different situations have in common is that
a bidder has to differentiate different hand types but is running out of room to do 
so at a reasonable level. While frequently the word Lebensohl is used to refer to
a bid of 2N relaying to 3♣, that's really a misuse.  Rather, 2N as a relay to 3♣ is 
the signature bid of an idea.

A variant, Transfer Lebensohl, is becoming popular
among experts. A lesson on it is available from Gavin Wolpert at wolpertbridge.com.

There never was a player named Lebensohl, and Kenneth Lebensold, who got the credit
at one time, denies having created it. So arguably the convention should be spelled 
lebensohl.

Lebensohl After We Open 1N
--------------------------

Since life will usually be easy for us after we open 1N, opponents are motivated to
interfere.  That uses up the room we need to decide our :term:`strain` and level.  
Lebensohl gives up one natural reply in order to effectively double the remaining space.

Suppose we open 1N and this is overcalled. Of course, if responder
is weak they need do nothing. But what if responder is competitive or better?

For example, suppose responder has a good |5ormore| card suit and enough
values that he wishes to compete for a part-score or a game. Consider this bidding
sequence::

   1N (2♥) 3♣

Imagine responder has one of these two hands:

#. ♠xxx ♥xx ♦Jx ♣KQxxxx
#. ♠AQx ♥xx ♦Jx ♣KQxxxx

With (1), responder would like to have the contract be 3♣. With (2), responder would
like to force to game, probably 3N or 5♣, depending on opener's heart holding.

The one bid 3♣ cannot mean two things. It is ambiguous. 
Resolving ambiguity is the heart of Lebensohl.  How do we come up with a way to express 
these different hands?

When we have a |5ormore| card suit to show, it might be:

* Competitive, wanting to stop in responder's suit;
* Invitational;
* Game-forcing. 

We will use an artificial bid, called Lebensohl 2N, to effectively double the number
of 3-level bids available to us. This bid is called Lebensohl 2N. 
After we bid 2N!(relay), partner must bid 3♣. Then we
can make a three-level bid. So there are two ways, for example, to bid 3♦. Bid 3♦ right
away, or first bid 2N!(relay) and after opener bids 3♣, bid 3♦. 

Bidding immediately is called a "fast" bid; going through the relay first is
the "slow" bid. For suits, the fast bid will be the stronger way; for Stayman,
the slow cue bid will show a stopper, while the fast will deny one. For 3N, slow 
will show a stopper, fast will deny a stopper.

.. important:: 
   How We Treat Artificial Bids

When the intervenor has made a bid that shows one suit and an unknown second suit,
we ignore the second suit for the moment and proceed as if they had bid the known suit.
For example, a Cappelletti 2♥ bid shows "hearts and a minor". We'll react as if it 
was just hearts. A D.O.N.T. bid of 2♦ shows "diamonds and a major". We'll react as if
it was just diamonds. If the intervenor makes a bid showing two definite suits, see 
:ref:`Artificial Overcalls <Lebensohl2Suits>`, below.

Over Two-Level Overcalls 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. rubric::
   When Lebensohl Is Off
   
If the overcall was in clubs, or intervenor doubled, Lebensohl is off. Systems are on.
This is also true when they make an artificial 2♣ bid or an artificial double promising
one long suit.
   
Systems on means we use our normal bids, as if they had not bid. Double is
Stayman, 2♦ is a transfer to hearts, and so on. 

If they doubled for penalty, it is a :ref:`runout <runout>` situation. If they
made an artificial double that showed one definite suit, we treat it as if they
had bid that suit; but when the suit is unknown our system is on, and redouble
is Stayman. And as mentioned, if their double or 2♣ bid showed two definite
suits, or they made an artificial bid such as 2♦ meaning the majors, see
:ref:`Artificial Overcalls <Lebensohl2Suits>`, below.

So in particular:

* 1N (2♣! long suit) system is on, double is Stayman;
* 1N (2♣ natural) system is on, double is Stayman;
* 1N (2♣! clubs and spades) use two-suited defense, not Lebensohl;
* 1N (2♣! clubs and a higher) treat as a club bid, so system is on;
* 1N (2♦! diamonds and a higher) treat as Lebensohl for diamonds;
* 1N (2♣! a minor or both majors) system is on, double is Stayman;
* 1N (2♥! hearts and a minor) treat as Lebensohl for hearts;
* 1N (X) use our runout system
* 1N (X! long suit) system is on, redouble is Stayman.

.. rubric::
   Over 2♦, 2♥, or 2♠

Over their two-level overcall of 2♦, 2♥, or 2♠ (or a bid showing that suit and another
unknown suit):

* A two-level suit bid is non-forcing ("to play").
* A three-level suit bid is game-forcing (fast bid).
* A bid of 2N!(relay to 3♣) forces opener to bid 3♣. Now responder:

  - Can pass with a weak hand with long clubs;
  - Bid a suit of lower rank than the overcall as a signoff (slow bid); or
  - Bid a suit of a higher rank than the overcall as invitational.
  
Note that a direct three-level bid might be a jump (e.g. 1N - (2♥) - 3♠) but it
isn't weak because if you were weak you could have just passed.

Further, if responder has a game-forcing hand he can show other hand types besides a 
suit of his own:

* An immediate bid of 3N over the overcall denies an unbid four-card major and denies
  a stopper.
* A "slow" 3N bid denies an unbid four-card major and shows a stopper.

One can also still make normal bids at the four-level.

-  4♣ is Gerber.
-  4♦! and 4♥! are Texas Transfers to hearts and spades, 
   showing six card suits and values for game only. With a strong hand and a
   six-card major game-force at the three level first.
-  4♠! (rare) invites opener to pick a minor game.
-  4N is invitational to 6N and of course promises a stopper.

The sharp-eyed reader will have noticed that there is no way to invite in notrump
(we gave it up for the Lebensohl 2N), and there is no way to invite in a suit of
lower-rank than the overcall. When 
responder has a higher-ranked suit he has three ways to bid it, e.g.:

* 2S -- to play
* 2N relay then 3S -- invitational
* 3S -- game-forcing

But when the responder's suit is lower-ranked, the 2-level bid does not exist,
so the relay has to mean the "to play" bid and we just don't have an
invitational bid.

   Stayman: An Evolving Story
   
.. index::
   pair: double;Lebensohl
   pair: Stayman;Lebensohl
   
In standard bidding, without Lebensohl, a cue bid of the overcalled suit is
Stayman. For example, 1N (2♦) 3♦ is Stayman. Obviously you need a game-forcing
hand.

There is a twist to the normal Stayman pattern, however. They have bid a suit.
Suppose opener replies spades but you have four hearts and not four spades. Can
you now bid 3N without a stopper in their suit?  If opener had neither major, can he bid 3N
without a stopper? It's ambiguous.  Sounds like a job for Lebensohl, and indeed
it used to be. 

The "original" Lebensohl (can we call it OGL?) approach is:

* An "fast" :term:`cue bid` is Stayman and denies a stopper in their suit.
* A "slow" cue bid is Stayman and shows a stopper. ("Slow shows").

After this the Stayman dance is modified in obvious ways. For example,
in these auctions, opener without a four-card major will have to bid:

- 3N if he has no unbid four-card major and either has a diamond stopper or was
  promised one by responder, or
- 4♣ to show responder that we lack a major fit or a diamond stopper.

Playing this way, a double is penalty-oriented.

The newer approach is to play a double as a negative double. The cue bids 
are not used for Stayman. It keeps the auction lower.

.. warning:: 
   You must be clear with your partner which version of double you are playing

.. rubric::
   Examples 
   
Five-card suit:

- 1N (2♦) 2♥ is to play
- 1N (2♦) 2N! - 3♣! - 3♥ is invitational
- 1N (2♦) 3♥ is game-forcing.
- 1N (2♥) 2N! - 3♦ is to play
- 1N (2♥) 3♦ is game-forcing; there is no way to invite in diamonds.
- 1N (2♣) 2♦ is a transfer to hearts. (Lebensohl off for clubs!)

Balanced hand, without a four-card major:

- 1N (2♦) 2N! - 3♣ - 3N  is to play, diamonds are stopped -- slow shows.
- 1N (2♦) 3N  wants to play 3N but does not have a diamond stopper.
  Opener will pass if he has one, or start suggesting suits up the line.

For the Stayman cases:

- 1N (2♦) X is Stayman if playing the double as negative; OR
- 1N (2♦) 3♦ is Stayman without a stopper, and
- 1N (2♦) 2N! - 3♣ - 3♦ is Stayman with a stopper.

.. note::
   Do not call the 2N bid by itself "Lebensohl".
   Lebensohl is the entire system described in this chapter. The 2N bid 
   is its signature, but it isn't the only thing to know.  

Three-level Overcalls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Over three-level overcalls, we obviously cannot use the Lebensohl 2N bid. A suggestion:

-  A double is for takeout, showing support for the other three suits.
-  Bids at the three level are natural, one-round forcing, and
-  3N, 4♥, 4♠, 5♣, and 5♦ are to play. I suggest 3N promises a stopper. 
-  A cue bid is Stayman, or may show slam interest lacking a four-card major:

   * 1N (3♦) 4♦ – 4♥ – 4N (to play)
   * 1N (3♦) 4♦ – 4N(no major) - Pass
   * 1N (3♦) 4♦ – 4? – 5♣ (slam interest in clubs)

.. _Lebensohl2Suits:

Two-Suited Overcalls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If their overcall shows two definite suits, Lebensohl is off. I like to use the
spirit of the :ref:`General Defense To Two-Suited Bids <defense_two_suited>`,
letting the invisible cue bids show a game-forcing bid of responder's suit
using the lower-lower concept, and letting double show a penalty double of one
of their suits. Bidding one of "our" two suits naturally is to play if we can
bid it at the 2-level.

When we speak of the overcalled suit or suits, we mean the ones their bid
*showed*, not the artificial one actually bid. E.g. a Cappelletti 2♦ meaning 
"both majors" makes the two major suits "theirs" and diamonds is one of "ours".

Doubling says you have a penalty double in at least one of their suits.

Rodwell in :title:`Lebensohl` (See :ref:`Resources <Resources>`) has a more
complicated scheme.

Answering Takeout Doubles Of Weak Two Bids
------------------------------------------

When an opponent opens a weak two bid, and we double it, that shows a decent
opening hand with shortness in their suit. The double is for takeout.
But we run into a familiar dilemma. Consider an auction that begins (2♥)
X (P) ? where the advancer holds a very weak hand with six diamonds.
Advancer definitely wants to bid three diamonds and have that be that.

But if he has a much stronger hand with diamonds that wants to go to game,
then he wishes he could ask partner whether he has hearts stopped.

The solution is to realize that (2♥) X (P) ? is not that different from
1N (2♥) ?. We can just play Lebensohl. The doubler can refuse a 2N! relay to 
show a strong hand.

There is one more scenario that should be considered Lebensohl::

   (1x) X (2x) ?
   
where x is not clubs. This is similar to (2x) X (P) ? Thus, play 2N here as
the relay to clubs.  This means:

* 2y is to play
* 2N is a relay to 3♣, pass or correct. To play if the suit was not biddable at the 
  level, otherwise invitational.
* 3-level bids are game forcing. 

Again, refusing the relay shows a strong hand. 

.. index::
   pair:overcall of 2♣ opener;Lebensohl
   
When They Overcall Our Two Club Opener
--------------------------------------

The auction 2♣ (2♥) is similar to 1N (2♥). We have the same dilemma of
wanting to compete but not wanting to confuse partner as to our hand
strength. Lebensohl can be used in these situations. If opponents play
2♣ (X) as showing the majors we would treat that as a two-suited bid in
hearts and spades.

.. index::
   pair: reverse; Lebensohl

Lebensohl Over Reverses
-----------------------

Imagine this headache: partner opens 1♣, you bid 1♠ with a minimal
four-card holding, and partner reverses with 2♥. This is forcing for one
round. What to do? If you had five spades you could just bid 2♠. But
let's say you don't, but you do prefer clubs or have five diamonds you
by-passed in order to show your four-card major.

If you just bid 3♣ as a preference, that's ok – until the next time when
you have a better hand and can't bid 3♣ because the partnership has
decided it is to play. Hmm. This sounds familiar – it is the same ambiguity
as 1N (2♥) 3♣ – what does it mean? And the dilemma has the same solution –
Lebensohl.

So, for example, a direct bid of 3♣ over a 2♥ reverse is game-forcing. A
“slow” trip to 3♣ via 2N, lets you pass and stop there.

Simplified Lebensohl
--------------------

If you do not feel comfortable with full Lebensohl, use this simpler version of 
it.  It covers most responder hand types.  

The opposition has bid a suit 2♦, 2♥, or 2♠ over our 1N opener.

- Double is penalty-oriented with at least two cards in their suit.
- Two-level suit bids are to play
- Three-level suit bids are game forcing
- 2N! is a relay to 3♣!(forced), pass or correct.  If responder corrects to a 
  suit he could have bid at the two-level, it is invitational; otherwise, to play.
- 3N is to play with a stopper.
- A cue bid is game-forcing Stayman. Opener should show a major if he has one.

When you've been bitten enough times by the holes in the simplification, you can learn 
the rest of it. 

You can get super-simplified by just remembering the 2-level is to play, 
and 2N is a relay to 3♣, pass or correct.  Ordinary bridge logic should kick in from
there. 

Good - Bad 2N
-------------

.. index:: Good-Bad 2N

.. index::
   pair: Good-Bad 2N; Lebensohl

This Lebensohl variant is explained most fully in Larry Cohen's "To Bid Or Not To Bid"
and in Marty Bergen's "Better Bidding With Bergen".  

In a competitive auction, it is your turn to bid and RHO has just bid 2x, whether as
a raise of his partner or a new suit, after your partner doubled or made an
overcall.  For example, let's suppose the auction went (1♥) - 1♠ - (2♥).  Suppose you
have a good diamond suit but no spade support.  Then what does your 3♦ bid show?
Most of the time of course you're just trying to compete but other times you have a 
extras and partner may wish to go higher knowing that. 

Enter the Good - Bad 2N, created by Larry Cohen in his book "To Bid Or Not To Bid".  
Whenever we are in a competitive suit auction and our RHO has made a 2-level bid, 2N! is a 
relay to 3♣, pass or correct.  Bidding directly on the three level shows extras. 

Take for example this auction::

   (1♠) 2♦ (2♠) ?

Without an agreement, a 3♦ bid here is hard to read. With Good - Bad 2N, 3♦ might be 
a good four-card diamond suit with 9 points, while 2N!(relay) - 3♣!(forced) - 3♦ might be 
only six points and partner will know not to compete further.

This convention also applies when you opened::

   1♥(you) (2♣) Pass (2♠)
   
If you have a two-suiter in hearts and diamonds, you want to distinguish 3♦ giving 
partner a choice vs. 3♦ showing something like an 18-point 5-5 hand. 

You must draw inferences when partner does not use the relay when he could have.

With some experience, you can use the Good - Bad distinction in many other competitive
auctions.  According to "Better Bidding With Bergen", it is important that this convention 
be off in situations such as:

* where 2N is clearly Unusual 2N
* when either side has opened 1N
* when the opponents opened a strong 1♣!. 
* when the opponents have made a penalty double
* when we have already found a fit
* when we are already in a game-forcing auction.
