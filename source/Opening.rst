Opening The Bidding
===================


What Hands To Open
------------------

Open all hands with 13 or more HCP, almost all hands with 12, and any hand with an Ace 
in one suit and an AK in another.  

Hands with more extreme distributions can open with fewer points.
Use the :term:`Rule of` 20: Add your HCP and the lengths of your longest two 
suits; if the total is 20 or more, consider opening the hand if you have at least 
10 HCP. 

However, I suggest you do not open using the rule of 20 when your two suits are
the minors. Why?  Because opening the bidding is a two-edged sword. When you
bid, the requirements for your opponent to bid over you are less than for them
to open the bidding. When you open one of a minor, the opponents can mention
either major cheaply.  Conversely, opening 1♠ makes life tough on them, and so
you can shade your 1h♠ requirements.

In third seat, chances are greatly
increased that your LHO will open. Bergen says one estimate is to subtract your points
from 24, and that's the average number LHO will have. Therefore your incentive to 
bid to at least show your partner what to lead goes up in third seat, and so does your
incentive to :term:`preempt` (opening a weak hand at the two or three level). You 
may open "light" (perhaps as few as 10 HCP with a major suit).

In fourth seat, use "Pearson Points": add your HCP and your number of spades. If you 
have 15 or more, open. Always open with 13 HCP.

There are always other considerations to ponder as well, such as seat and vulnerability.
Generally, second seat and vulnerable are good times to be somewhat careful.

In the :term:`ACBL` it is not legal to open one of a suit with a hand
containing fewer than 8 HCP unless it fulfills the "Rule of 17". In a limited
game using the "Basic" chart this is the "Rule of 19". However, be very
reluctant to open one of a suit with fewer than 10 HCP.  Your opponents are more
likely to compete than usual, and your partner may end up doubling them because
he thinks you have a better hand than you do.

The opening bids are:

* Opening 1N to show :term:`balanced` (and sometimes 
  :term:`semi-balanced`) hands of 15 to 17 HCP. 
  
* Opening 2N to show :term:`balanced` (and sometimes 
  :term:`semi-balanced`) hands of 20 to 21 HCP. 
  
* Opening one of a suit to show an unbalanced hand or a balanced one with too few HCP
  to open 1N, and up to 21 HCP.
  
* Opening 2♣ (artificial) to show a very strong hand (|22ormore| HCP balanced or 
  somewhat fewer with a long, strong suit). Forcing!
  
The opening bids from 2♦ through 5♦ are :term:`preemptive`.  Do not make them with
weak hands even though you have the correct length. Note that you and your partner
must agree on how strong your suit is. One suggested agreement is that a preempt 
promises at least a Queen in the suit if non-vulnerable, or a :term:`good suit` 
(two of top three honors or three of the top five, excluding QJT) if vulnerable. 

In third seat you can stretch a bit. Be careful not to preempt with too good a holding; 
many 10 HCP hands are too good for that.
  
* 2♦, 2♥, 2♠ show a usually |6ormore|-card suit and 5-10 HCP.
* 3♣, 3♦, 3♥, 3♠ show a usually seven-card suit and 5-10 HCP. Sometimes 3♣ is bid with 
  six good clubs, since the 2♣ bid can't be used.
* Opening four of a major shows an eight-card suit. 
  Usually we don't do that in a minor since it tends to push them to bid a major
  game out of desperation. Instead use five of the minor. These are weak bids -- 
  don't make them with good hands.
  
The next few chapters will give details on these bids and their sequelae. 

Choosing An Opening Bid
-----------------------

The basic rules are simple and depend only on your strength and shape. Choose the first 
bid in the following lists that applies:

* If a preempt is appropriate, make it.
* Open 2♣ with |22ormore| points (some slightly weaker hands with great long suits are 
  also appropriate).
* Open 2N if you have a balanced hand with 20-21 points. 
* Open 1N if you have a balanced hand with 15-17 points.

If you have 12-21 points (or an 11 HCP hand with an AK in one suit and another A):

* Open the longest five-card or longer suit at the one-level. If you have two suits
  that are the same length, open the higher ranked.
* Open 1♦ if you have four diamonds and four or fewer clubs.
* Open 1♦ if your shape is exactly 4=4=3=2.
* Open 1♣.

In following the rules for bidding, you almost always disregard the
quality of the suits. It's all about shape. This applies to many situations, not just
the opening bid.

Beyond The Basic Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Breaking the rules is possible. The cases where you might consider it involve 
thinking ahead to what happens later. 

.. note::

   Ignore this section until you are utterly reliable recognizing the basic bids.  

* With five clubs and four diamonds, you can open one diamond with less than 17 points.
  You aren't strong enough to bid 2♦ on your second bid if you open 1♣, and rebidding
  clubs usually shows |6ormore| clubs. So you can consider the qualities of each 
  suit to choose which lie you are willing to tell. Experts don't do this but they have
  additional tools to cope with the situation.
  
* With a 4=5=2=2 hand and 14-16 points you might open 1N, as long as one of the doubletons
  is Kx or better. You aren't strong enough to bid 2♠ on your second bid if you
  open 1♥.
  
* With a hand 4-4 in the minors, you have to think about what you are going to do if
  your partner responds with a major. If you are going to be bidding 1N, you are 
  losing a club suit fit if one exists.  If you are going to rebid 2♣ your partner will 
  expect an unbalanced hand.  So if you plan to rebid 1N, open 1♣.
  
* Some players play "better minor", that is, if 3-3 in the minors they will open the
  diamond suit if it is better than the club suit. This is especially true in third
  seat with a minimal opener -- you rather expect your LHO is going to overcall and 
  your partner may end up on opening lead, so you show the suit you want led.  
  
  This has a downside: if you don't do this, partner can count on your having 4 diamonds 
  when you open a diamond 95% of the time. 

* With a balanced hand with 17 HCP, if you have a decent five-card suit as well, 
  consider bidding the hand as an 18 point hand, which means open the suit and rebid 2N
  if not raised.
  
  Conversely, do not downgrade 18 HCP to a 1N opener, ever. There is no "bad 18".
  
* It is legal to open 1N with a singleton A, K, or Q. If you never do this it will be 
  fine.  Strangely, it is better with a K or Q rather than an Ace since someone with
  the Ace may underlead it. Again, people tend to do this because looking ahead, they
  worry about a 1N rebid underselling their hand, but 2N overselling it. 
  
Opening in 4th Seat
-------------------

.. index::
   pair: preempt; not in passout seat
   pair: opening; in passout seat

Pearson Points: To find your Pearson Points, add your HCP to the number of
spades you hold. If this number is 15 or more, open the bidding. The idea is
that getting into a part-score battle when your opponents are likely to have
the spade suit is probably changing their score from zero if you pass it out to
some positive number. 

Larry Cohen has this take on it: CRIFS (Cohen's Rule In Fourth Seat): If you have
a borderline situation (10-12 HCP), evaluate your opponents! If you are playing one
of the better pairs, pass. They may take you to the cleaners in a part-score battle.

In fourth ("passout") seat it makes no sense to preempt. You can "keep them out
of it" with a pass. So the range of a "weak two" becomes 10-14 HCP. 

Opening at the three- or four-level is likewise not weak in passout seat.

In :ref:`The Hand <TheHand>` we met these two hands and evaluated them to around
16 and 15 points each:

::

   West           East
   ♠K862          ♠AQ
   ♥AKJ95         ♥T632
   ♦T5            ♦AKQ6
   ♣KJ            ♣964 

What would East open? 15 HCP, balanced, we open 1N.  In real life East was the dealer
and did so. 

But what would West open? That's a little harder. The textbook says 1♥.
Hearts is the longest suit, and it is a five-card major.  Is that all there is to say?
No. West would also consider opening 1N to avoid 
the rebid problem: if East answers 1N, West is shy of the values for a reverse to 2♠.
As we'll see, West would be forced into a lie of one kind or another.
