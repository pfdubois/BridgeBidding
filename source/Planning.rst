Planning The Auction
====================

Before making any bid we should note our position, vulnerability, and classify our hand.
We sometimes have to anticipate our next bid in choosing the current one.

Note Your Seat!
---------------

You must always check your position and vulnerability. If you have not previously
passed ("an unpassed hand"), there are slightly different rules than if you are.
Some rules for passed hands are sometimes labeled "BPH" (By Passed Hand). vulnerability
factors in less than you think, but it is important in preemptive bidding and other
competitive situations.

.. _classification:

.. index::classifying your hand

Classifying Your Hand
---------------------

Assume that your partner opened one of any suit, your RHO passed, and it is
your bid. The key is to know whether your hand is weak, competitive,
invitational, game-going, or has slam-interest, and to constantly re-evaluate
it as the auction proceeds. This classification is the same no matter what suit
your partner opened.

* Weak: under six points
* Competitive: six to a poor 10 points. Also called "minimal".
* Invitational: ten to twelve points. Also called "limit".
* Game-going: 13+ points
* Slam interest: When we either have 33 points between us, or have found a suit fit 
  and are not too far below that.

.. note:
   New suit responses at the one level are unlimited by an unpassed hand. 
   Opener must not pass them. 

When you are a passed hand if partner bids a suit you can support, the classification
of your hand may improve. However, expectations are modest.  Almost nothing a passed hand 
can do is forcing.
  
The idea is that to be at the two-level it would be nice if we had at least more points
than they do. After all, we're contracting to make 8 out of 13 tricks, which is 62%.
While being able to name the strain will help, having less than 50% of the points
could be a problem.

For a suit at the three level, we want around 23 points.  We contracting for
69% of the tricks. Considering HCP only, 23 out of 40 is 57%.  For notrump we'd
want 25 HCP at least, and Charles Goren wanted 26.  You won't make it all the
time, even so.

For a game in a major suit look for a combined 26 points, and for a minor, around 29.

Is This Forcing?
----------------

As we begin our study, some advice: the key to bidding is understanding passing!  
The most two common mistakes are:

* Bidding when you should have passed, and
* Passing when you were required to bid.

So, pay great attention in studying to know which bids are forcing to game,
forcing for one round, or not forcing. If your partner makes a bid you don't
understand, don't just pass in confusion. Rethink the sequence so far to see if
you've misinterpreted something -- not an easy task, as the brain tends to take
us down little rat-holes. Was there a conventional bid you missed? 
If still confused do something, something as obvious
as possible. The GOAT, Bob Hamman, said: when in doubt bid three no-trump.

When partner makes a forcing bid you must notice their message and respond if that
message is compelling enough, but if they bid before you get that chance, you're 
"off the hook".

One rule is ironclad: a new suit bid by an unpassed :term:`responder` is forcing 
for one round; that is, the opener must respond to it IF the opponents are silent.
The opposite is true when a passed hand bids -- almost nothing they do is forcing 
except some doubles and artificial bids.

The Captain Concept
-------------------

The :term:`Captain` of a hand means the partner who becomes in charge of guiding the
partnership to a good spot to play. When one player has shown
the strength and nature of his hand (generally called limiting his hand, 
because it refers to having shown limits on the hand's strength), the other
partner becomes Captain. For example, after a no-trump opener, opener's strength is known 
to within three points, and the responder is the Captain.

When partner is Captain, go to your cabin, look out the porthole, and enjoy the 
view. Your partner may go to game or tell you to stop;  obey the
Captain. Otherwise, just answer his questions or show something new about your
hand if his bid was forcing. The Captain may put control back into your
hands by making an invitational, non-forcing bid.  

.. _Reverses:

.. index::reverse

During the auction, both as opener and as responder, we need to plan our path
forward.  There is a concept called a reverse that is crucial, so we have to 
discuss that before we get specific.

Reverses by Opener
------------------

Imagine an auction that begins 1♦ - 1♠ - 2♥. As we will see, if responder has six
to a bad ten HCP, they can only bid once, except to make a final choice of suits if
necessary.  For example, after 1♦ - 1♠ - 2♥, responder with such a hand must choose
between diamonds, hearts, or his own spades.  If he only has four spades, he has to
choose one of opener's suits.

But if responder cannot agree to hearts, his bid of 3♦ may be too high.  The
partnership might have less than half the points between them, yet we're promising to
take 9 of the 13 tricks. For this to be safe, opener would need around seventeen
points.

Compare this to 1♥ - 1♠ - 2♣. Now if responder has to prefer hearts to clubs, a 2♥ bid
is comfortable. Opener with a big hand might bid again, but at least they know we 
have a minimum. 

So what caused the problem? It was that opener's first suit was lower ranked than
his second. Therefore the opener needs a very good hand to do that.

A :term:`reverse` by opener is a rebid that meets two tests:

#. Opener's rebid is in a suit higher than his original suit, AND
#. Opener's rebid is a level higher than responder's bid.

A reverse shows about 17-18 points and an unbalanced hand with 
more cards in the first suit than in the second. A reverse is 
absolutely forcing for one round unless opponents interfere, but not forcing to game.
We can take length points into account. A few shapely hands with 15-16 hands 
qualify as well. 

.. note::

   The second bid suit is always shorter and higher-ranked than the first bid suit.
   Opener cannot "reverse" from one four-card suit into another. 

Example: 1♦ - 1♠ - 2♥. Hearts is higher than diamonds, and the 2♥ bid is up a level. 
Opener has more at least as many diamonds as hearts (typically 5-4).  

There is one important exception. If responder has made a two-level bid he has shown at 
least 10 points, so if responder has to preference to 3♥, there is no problem -- we're 
already known to have around 23 points. Therefore, we do not consider a 2-level
continuation a reverse. For example, Pass - 1♥ - 2♣ - 2♥. The 2♣ bid shows 10+ points.

When you have a five-card suit and a higher four-card suit,
you have to open the five-card suit, but on your rebid you 
cannot show your four-card suit unless you have the values.  

For example, with five diamonds and four hearts, if the auction goes 1♦ - 1♠ - 2♥, opener 
has reversed. Lacking that many points, opener may have to bid an imperfect 1N or repeat
diamonds instead. 

With 4 diamonds and 5 clubs, such as ♠92 ♥Q9 ♦AQJ5 ♣KQT43, we have a similar
dilemma but without the risk of hiding a major. If we open this hand 1♣, and
partner answers with a major or notrump, we have a problem. So some people will
open this hand 1♦ instead.  Others will bite the bullet, open 1♣, and rebid 2♣
if they have to, even though that suggests you might have a six card suit. 

Obviously the quality of the two suits will influence the decision, unless you just  
always open 1♣. 

.. note::
   When you make your opening bid, you'll always need to think about what you'll do next 
   depending on what your partner does. 
   
What If Opener Is Stronger?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _wjs_choice:

.. index:: jump-shift choice

Since a reverse is forcing one round, you can sometimes use it when nothing
else is available to keep the auction going. But in general, if your hand is
19+ points, and you have a good suit, you might think of jumping a level in a
new suit. This is called a :term:`jump-shift`.

If the opponents have competed, a jump-shift is weak unless the context gives
it another meaning. For example, 1♥ - (2♣) - 3♦ is a weak jump-shift, where the
responder has a preemptive diamond hand and can't support hearts. But 1♥ - 3♦
is a jump-shift whose meaning is either a strong 19+ hand with good diamonds or
a weak diamond preemptive hand.

Partnerships must decide on a meaning for a :term:`jump-shift` when there is no
competition. The standard meaning is a strong bid (19+ points) but this meaning
is less useful than it was before 2/1 was invented. I think most pairs play
weak jump-shifts so I will assume that. See :ref:`All About Jump-Shifts
<Jump_Shifts>`.

Responding To Opener's Reverse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If opener has reversed, as responder you must bid unless your RHO takes you off the hook 
by interfering. If you have a good 8 points or more, you'll want to get to game.

So the problem is what to do with a minimal hand. If you bid opener's first suit, it is 
a simple preference with a minimal hand. If you repeat your own major suit, you're showing 
five cards and a minimum.  

.. index::
   convention;Ingberman
   convention;Lebensohl
   
Optionally, 2N!(relay) is a conventional bid telling your partner that you may
have a minimal hand. It asks opener to rebid his first suit; then you will pass
or correct to your suit. This convention is called Ingberman 2N or Lebensohl
Over Reverses.  Your partner should say "alert" (which is why I used the
exclamation point).

Any bid other than a suit preference or 2N is game forcing when using this convention.

Downey and Pomer's book :title:`Standard Bidding With SAYC` has a long 
section on reverses with a lot of examples.

Reverses By Responder
---------------------

.. index::
   pair:reverse;responder
   
When responder reverses, it is just a game-forcing natural bid. For example, 
1♠ - 2♣ - 2♠ - 3♦ is a game-forcing reverse, since diamonds are a higher
suit than clubs. Again, the same principal is at work; an opener who wanted to prefer
clubs is now forced up a level compared to bidding diamonds first and clubs second.

Note that 1♣ - 1♦ - 1♥ - 1♠ does not count as a reverse; we're not up a level. But 
bidding 2♠, not 1♠, is a jump shift and game forcing. For this reason it is best to
treat this 1♠ bid as forcing.   

Sometimes a responder reverse is the fourth suit bid and therefore unlikely to find a fit 
with partner, so most play it as a conventional bid that is one-round or game-forcing but 
not showing that suit, asking partner to  bid notrump with a stopper in the fourth suit.  
See :ref:`Fourth Suit Forcing <FSF>`.
