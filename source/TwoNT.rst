The 2N Opening Family
=====================

.. _open2N:

.. index:: 
   pair: opening; balanced
   pair: opening; 2N
   pair: opening; 2♣

What Hands Are Included?
------------------------

Opening 2N shows a balanced hand with 20-21 points. The hand may contain a five
card major. Experts will often open a 5-4-2-2 hand with 2N, and certainly a
5-3-3-2. As with opening 1N, opening 2N nails down opener's strength to a small
range, and responder becomes :term:`Captain` of the hand.

With 22-24 points, a balanced 2♣ opener rebids 2N; respond to that 2N bid
*exactly* as if the opener had opened 2N except that he has a few more points.
We refer to these agreements as the 2N opening family.

A hand that is 1=4=4=4 can be opened 2N with a singleton ♠K, but not an ♠A.  If
you open it 1♦ you'd have a choice over partner's expected spade bid of jump
shifting to 3♣, losing the hearts, or reversing into hearts without longer
diamonds than hearts, which is not permitted. Opening 2N may be the least evil.

.. _open2NR:

Unlike the situation over 1N, there is no room for many conventions; in particular,  
there is no escape sequence to get out in a minor. Otherwise:

* Pass with less than game-going values (5 HCP or perhaps an Ace)
* 3♣ is Stayman. What variant of Stayman is a choice, see below.   
* 3♦ and 3♥ are major transfers. 
* 3♠ is up for discussion; see below.
* 4♣ is :ref:`Gerber <Gerber>`. 
* 4♦ and 4♥ are :ref:`Texas Transfers <Texas>`, if you play them. 
* 4N is quantitative, asking opener to bid 6N with a hand with good trick-taking ability.
* 6N means you are sure we have 33 HCP but not 37 HCP.
* 7N means you're having a good day.
 
Some play 3♣ as :ref:`Puppet Stayman <Puppet_Stayman>`. 
Unfortunately you can't play both :ref:`Smolen <Smolen>` and Puppet because of the 
different meanings of a 3♦ reply by opener.  Expert opinion favors plain Stayman
with Smolen or a more complicated version of Puppet, according to Gavin Wolpert. 
Most ordinary players play Puppet Stayman, or even ordinary Stayman without Smolen.
You can do fine with just ordinary Stayman.

As a general rule, when responding with a hand with a five-card major, we transfer to it 
and then show the other suit when game forcing. With 5=5 in the majors, a transfer to 
spades and then bidding hearts is offering opener a choice of 4♥ or 4♠, while
transferring to hearts and then bidding spades is more interested in slam.

As with the 1N opener, holding 5-4 in the majors, responder can bid 3♣ and if opener 
replies 3♦, puppet the four-card major suit (:ref:`Smolen<Smolen>`).  Or, partners can 
agree to use Puppet Stayman.

Notes on 3 Spades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some intermediates play that 3♠ is a relay to 4♣, analogous to the minor relay 2♠ over 1N,
intending to get out in a minor. This is a bad idea over 2N; pick between pass and 3N. 

Any agreement about 3♠ suffers from the problem that opener's RHO can double for a 
spade lead, possibly sinking the ship.  We really have to be serious about a possible
minor slam before risking this.

A common agreement is :ref:`Minor Suit Stayman <MSS>`, showing both minor suits, below.

See :ref:`Advanced 2N Bidding <advanced2N>` for a more expert systems.

I have no section on dealing with interference over a 2N opener because doing so is 
almost never advisable. As a general rule, responder as Captain would deal with it.

.. _MSS:

.. index:: Minor Suit Stayman

.. rubric:: Minor Suit Stayman

A bid of 3♠ shows at least 5-4 in the minor suits and of course the values for game.  
Opener can bid:

* 3N to deny a four-card minor
* 4m to show a four-card minor
* 4♥ to show a slam interest with |5ormore| clubs.
* 4♠ to show a slam interest with |5ormore| diamonds.

Playing in notrump is always on the table.


Note: Some play MSS over 1N too, but most experts deal with such hands using the 3-level 
"splinter" methods.
