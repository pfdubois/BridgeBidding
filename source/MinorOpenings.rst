Responding To Minor Openings
============================

.. _Minor_Openings:

.. index::
   pair: opening; minor
   pair: responding; 1m

Our partner has opened 1♣ or 1♦. If we mean either we can write "1m". Partner
could have a three-card suit but most of the time it is four or five cards. For
diamonds, only 5% of the time do we have only a three card suit.

So where are we going? If we don't have 25 points or more, we want to stop in
the cheapest suitable contract we can find. If we have game strength, we hope
to find a 4-4 fit for a major, if possible, but more often our game, if we have
one, is 3NT. If they compete we might find a suit is unstopped. In that case we
may stop at 4 of a minor or press on to 5 of a minor, or even sometimes settle
for a 4-3 fit in a major.

In a possible slam exploration, the point at which we go past 3N is a point of
no return, and we should be thinking of the alternative to 3N as six of our
minor. Especially playing matchpoints, bidding five of a minor when a 3N
contract is making is a recipe for a bottom score.

.. note::
   When an unpassed responder bids a new suit at the lowest level he can, 
   it is always forcing for one round.
   Raises aren't forcing, nor are notrump responses.

Responding To One Of A Minor
----------------------------

Before choosing a response, remember to take note of your seat, the vulnerability,
and do a classification of your hand. See :ref:`Planning The Auction <planning>`.

Responding With A Weak Hand 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With a weak hand just pass. If there has been interference from your RHO, and you have
five of partner's minor, you can bid a weak 3m as a :term:`preemptive` raise.

Responding With A Competitive Hand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With a competitive (6-10 point) hand bid the first of these bids that applies. 

* Show a major: bid a four-card or longer major. If you have hearts and spades of equal 
  length, bid a heart.
* Raise partner: 2m shows five or more cards in m. Sometimes bid with four good diamonds, 
  and a maximum, but not with four clubs. 
* Show a diamond suit: 1♦ shows four or more diamonds. 
* Otherwise bid 1N. If partner opened 1♦ you can't bid 2♣.

You cannot pass with six or more points. Bidding 1N does not promise a balanced
hand or any particular stoppers. It simply denies the other bids, and denies an
invitational hand.
   
With a competitive hand you are only going to get one shot 
at saying you have a major, so you prefer to mention that first.  Here's an example::

   ♠A4
   ♥9876
   ♦KQ762
   ♣97
   
Partner opens 1♣. You bid 1♥. (If you had four spades as well, you'd still bid hearts,
up the line.)  The problem is that you can't bid 1♦ and then try to show hearts later;
that would be a responder :term:`reverse` and show a game-forcing hand.

Responding With An Invitational Hand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With a good 10 to 12 points, showing a major suit remains
your priority. You'll show your strength and leave it up to partner. 

Here are the priorities:

- Show a major. 
- Raise partner: 3m is a :term:`limit raise`, with 5+ in m.  
- Show a diamond suit.  
- Invite in clubs: 1♦ - 3♣ is invitational with six clubs. As a passed hand, 
  or if there is interference, you can bid just 2♣. These bids are not forcing.
- Otherwise bid 2N.
  

Responding With A Game-Going Hand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the discussion of weak jump shifts in :ref:`All About Jump-Shifts <Jump_Shifts>`.
Unless we are playing strong jump-shifts, there is no game-forcing minor raise. 
To force to game, responder has to keep making bids that cannot be passed short of 
game, which in practice means bidding new suits or going past 3N.

The :ref:`Inverted Minors <inverted_minors>` convention helps alleviate this problem.
Inverted Minors is one of the 
:ref:`expected conventions with 2/1 <expected_conventions>`.

Responder's priorities are:

* Show a major.
* Show a diamond suit, usually 5+ cards.
* Bid 2♣ over 1♦. This game-forcing bid shows five clubs. (You can't be a passed hand).
* 1m - 3N shows 13-15 HCP and a semi-balanced hand with no four-card major.
  
Note that "Raise partner" isn't in the list.  As the auction progresses you must make 
bids partner cannot pass short of game.  

With no major suit fit you're headed for 3N unless the opponents' bidding makes
it clear that they have a suit and we do not have it stopped.  Do not worry
about stoppers in suits they didn't bid.

If you cannot get to 3N you may need to stop in 4m. Going to 5m has to usually include 
a lot of trumps and some shape. 

.. note::
   Bypassing a diamond suit to show a major is a style of bidding called :term:`Walsh`.  
   With less than game-forcing holdings one bypasses
   even five diamonds over partner's 1♣ to show the major. 

Looking For Slam
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bidding minor slams is awkward. Until you have agreed on a suit, 4N is not 
:ref:`Blackwood <Blackwood>` (an Ace-asking bid). Jumping to five of the minor is 
not inviting to slam, it is just shutting down with a distributional hand. All you 
can do is bid as if you seek only game, and then keep going if you're positive a slam
is likely. Going past 3N is crossing the Rubicon.

Opener's Rebid
--------------

If opener rebids 1N he promises a balanced hand. Never rebid 1N with a singleton or void.
This is very different than responder's 1N which is a 
"catch-all" merely showing that responder does not have a four-card suit to bid.

It is opener's turn to classify his hand (after revaluing it considering partner's 
response):

* up to 14 is a "minimum" hand; we don't have a game if partner has limited his hand
  to less than invitational.
* 15 - 17 is :term:`game try` territory. We *might* have a game. More about that later.
* 18 - 19 is almost enough for game even if responder has a minimum. We are anxious to
  show this by rebidding 2N if possible.
* 20-21 is game forcing. We might even be in a slam hunt.

If the bidding has gone 1m – 1♥, and we cannot support hearts, but we have four
spades, we must bid 1♠. Do not skip over 1♠ when you have four; responder could
have four hearts and four spades. This should be treated as forcing unless partner
is a passed hand.

It takes 17+ HCP to raise partner's major to the 3 level. With more than that,
you can bid game.  Or, you can show shortness on the way to game by splintering.
A :term:`splinter` is a triple jump and shows shortness. For example, 1♦ - 1♠ - 4♣! 
would show support for spades and shortness in clubs, with some slam interest. 
A splinter says, "I could have bid game even without this nifty shortness".  

Otherwise, an opener with a balanced hand and 12-14 points will rebid 1N
over responder's one of a suit bid. 

With 18-19 he rebids 2N. Note that the 2N rebid does not deny any major you may 
skip over: 

- 1♦ - 1♥ - 2N does not deny having four spades
- 1♦ - 1♠ - 2N does not deny having four hearts

An opener's jump-shift, such as 1♣ - 1♠ - 3♥, is a powerful hand, 19+, with good suits. 
This is very rare after a minor opening. Jump-shifts by opener are never weak because,
hey, he opened, he's not weak.

If responder has bid a major and we have four of them, or three of them and either a
singleton or no other good bid, we can raise. Mike Lawrence gives this example::

   ♠ 52
   ♥ QJ9
   ♦ AJ763
   ♣ KQ4

After 1♦ - 1♥, he recommends 2♥. If you bid 1N expect a spade lead and your goose may
be well done. That diamond suit does not merit a rebid. 

With an unbalanced hand opener can show a second suit, but a reverse requires 17+.
The most frequent case is 1♦ - 1x - 2♣, showing four diamonds and more diamonds than
clubs, and an unbalanced hand. 

Rebidding one's minor at the 2 level shows a
minimum opener and a six-card suit usually. A jump rebid of 1m - 3m is 15-17.

 
The :ref:`New Minor Forcing <NMF>` convention helps find 3-5 and 4-4
fits in such situations. 

.. note::
   The system we use after :ref:`opening a notrump <strong1N>`
   does not apply after we *rebid* 1N and likewise the system 
   :ref:`after we *open* 2N <open2N>` does not apply after a 2N *rebid*. Those systems 
   do apply when we *overcall* in notrump.


After A Game-forcing Two Over One
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::1♦ - 2♣ game forcing

We're look for 3N. Opener's rebids are:

-  2♦ (catchall) shows 5 diamonds, any strength, does not deny a
   four-card major. Have six diamonds if possible.
-  2♥ or 2♠ shows a 4-card major, denies five cards unless suit is rebid
   on next round to show a 5-6 hand. Because we are in a game-forcing auction, this
   is not a :term:`reverse`, so does not require extra strength. 
-  3♣ raises clubs. 
-  2N shows stoppers in both majors, does not deny a four-card major.
   This is not an invitational bid; the auction is game forcing. We're just going slow
   to give responder more space to describe their hand.
-  3N shows 18-19 balanced, stoppers.


Subsequent Bidding
------------------

.. index::
   pair:convention;NMF
   pair;convention;FSF
   single:checkback 
   
If responder has bid a major, and opener does not have four cards in it, there might
still be a 3-5 major fit.  Or, there might be a four-four fit in the other major, 
for example when responder has five spades and four hearts but opener has 
two spades and four hearts.

Two :ref:`expected conventions <expected_conventions>` that solve the problem of 
detecting such fits are covered in the next chapter, 
:ref:`Basic Checkback <Checkback>`: New Minor Forcing and Fourth Suit Forcing.


Interference
------------

.. index::
   pair:cue bid;limit raise
   pair:overcall;weak jump

A minor is so easy to overcall, it happens a lot, so we must be prepared. 
Responder's bids over the overcall mean
what they would have meant, except that the limit raise or better is shown
with a :term:`cue bid`. That's a bid of *their* suit, such as 1♣ - (1♥) - 2♥.
That has the same meaning as 1♣ - 3♣.

A cue bid at the three level after partner's 1m opener is overcalled is 
:ref:`Western Cue <Western_Cue>`, asking partner to bid 3N with a stopper in
their suit. A Wester Cue bids says, "We have the points for game, partner, but I do not 
have a stopper.  I probably have something to help though." 

Worst case is they have a nine-card fit in a major suit.  Without two good stoppers 3N
will be a very poor contract. 

.. _inverted_minors:

.. index::
   pair: convention; inverted minors

Inverted Minors
---------------

Inverted Minors is listed as one of the 
:ref:`expected conventions <expected_conventions>` for a 2/1 player but you can 
not play it without a lot of harm.

Inverted minors reverse the meanings of the raises of a
minor, so that the 1m - 2m raise is strong and the 1m - 3m raise is weak
(preemptive).  Inverted Minors require partnership agreement.  

The requirements to raise from 1m to 2m!(inverted) are:

-  10+ points
-  5+ cards in the minor, or four really good ones if it is diamonds.
-  No four card major

The 2m bid must be alerted. It is forcing for one round. In competition,
2m reverts to its standard meaning. If 3m is a jump, as in 1♦ - (1♥) - 3♦, it
is weak. 

After a strong raise, the partners bid stoppers up-the-line. While some do not 
look to confirm a stopper in the other minor, we do. The first party that 
knows we have stoppers bids 2N, or a responder with a game-forcing hand can 
go directly to 3N. "He who knows, goes", as Marty Bergen says. If 3N or 6m
is not possible we will head for 5m.  Stopping in 4m is possible but if 3N makes 
expect a score of 0%. 

Some experts prefer to use 3m as a "mixed" raise, showing 7-10 HCP, so that an
opener with 18-19 points can bid 3N, as their expert opponents blow by a 3m
preempt as if it were not there.
