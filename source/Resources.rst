Here are the sources I have found most useful on each topic.

Books
-----

#. My :title:`Advanced Bidding` and :title:`Defensive Bidding` are complements to these 
   notes, and should be available in the same place you found them.
   
#. :title:`Standard Bidding With SAYC`, by Ned Downey and Ellen Pomer, Masterpoint
   Press, Toronto, 2005. This really seems to be the only printed book
   devoted to this purpose, beyond a little handout you can get from ACBL.

#. :title:`25 Bridge Conventions You Should Know`, by Barbara Seagram and Marc Smith,
   Masterpoint Press, Toronto, 1999; and :title:`25 More Bridge Conventions You Should 
   Know`, by Barbara Seagram and Marc Smith, Masterpoint Press, Toronto, are
   wonderfully expository with reviews and quizzes.  All of the "25" series
   books have taught me something.  One of them is on Two Over One. 

#. :title:`2 Over 1 Game Force`, by Audrey Grant and Eric Rodwell, Baron Barclay, 
   Louisville, KY. 2009.  I do not care for the 2/1 books by Hardy (on literary, 
   not bridge, grounds).

#. :title:`Points Schmoints!`, by Marty Bergen, Bergen Press, Palm Beach Gardens, FL, 
   1994.

#. :title:`Slam Bidding Made Easier`, by Marty Bergen, Palm Beach Gardens, FL, 
   2008.  A workbook is also available.  This book contains the alternative
   hand evaluation method that Bergen devised in full detail, also with
   great details about control bidding and useful slam conventions.

#. :title:`The Weak No-trump: How to Play It, How to Play Against It`, by Andy Stark.

#. :title:`Eddie Kantar Teaches Modern Bridge Defense`, by Eddie Kantar, Masterpoint
   Press, Toronto, 1999. This part centers on leading, card play and signalling.

#. :title:`Eddie Kantar Teaches Advanced Bridge Defense`, by Eddie Kantar, Masterpoint
   Press, Toronto, ISBN 1-894154-03-7, 1999. This part centers on strategy,
   counting, and technique.

#. :title:`Opening Leads`, by Mike Lawrence, C & T Bridge Supplies, Los Alamitas, CA, 
   1966. This is so comprehensive it is a challenge but well worth it. 
   My scores improved sharply after I read it. Many of Lawrence's other
   writings on specialized topics, including balancing and overcalls, are
   similarly difficult and worthwhile.

#. :title:`Eddie Kantar Teaches Topics in Declarer Play at Bridge`, by Eddie Kantar,
   Master Point Press, Toronto, 2002.  There are many older such books,
   including ones by Dorothy Hayden Truscott and William S. Root, each
   of which is worth reading.

#. :title:`Card Play Technique, or, The Art Of Being Lucky`, by Victor Mollo and 
   Nico Gardener. B. T. Batsford Ltd., London, 1955.

#. :title:`The Play of the Hand At Bridge`, by Louis H. Watson. I first read this at age 
   12, when I had nobody to play with. I probably picked it out because it
   was one of the biggest books in our little public branch library. 
   First published in 1934, nowadays one reads the modernized 
   version by Sam Fry, Jr. written in 1958. It remains one of the best.
   
#. :title:`The Official Encylopedia of Bridge`, 7th Edition, Brent Manley ed., published
   by the American Contract Bridge League, Horn Lake, MS, 2011.
   Everything you ever wanted to know -- and the section on how to play card
   combinations is to be frequently consulted after you fail in that department.
   
Online
------
   
#. `Larry Cohen <http://larryco.com>`, `Robert Barrington <http://learnbridge.com>` and
   `Gavin Wolpert <http://wolpertbridge.com` have articles, videos
   and lessons.  YouTube has great content including Rob, Gavin, and Pete Hollands.

#. `Marty Bergen <http://martybergen.com>` has audio-visual courses in addition to books 
   and pamphlets.
   
#. The `Fifth Chair Foundation <www.fifthchair.org>`, has an historical 
   `archive <http://www.fifthchair.org/archive>`. 
   Two of the documents, :title:`SAYC OKBridge Style`, by Anna Marsh et. al., 
   and :title:`Two Over One OKBridge Style - Clarified`, by Anna Marsh et. al.,
   are pretty complete both as to system and many basic conventions.

#. `BBO <http://bridgebase.com>` 
   is home to massive amounts of material both directly and at the associated clubs such 
   as the Beginner and Intermediate Lounge (BIL) and the Intermediate and 
   Advanced Club (IAC). You can practice playing with three robots there,
   and mousing over the bids tells you what they will mean to the robots; but
   the robot plays Two Over One and a rather odd set of conventions.  There are many 
   other things there, including official ACBL games.
   
#. `ACBL.org <http://acbl.org>` -- be a member, see your points, look up convention 
   charts, what the convention card means, find a club or tournament. There is a really
   great series of explanations about how to fill out your convention card.
